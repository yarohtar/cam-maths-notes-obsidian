Let $\mathcal{G}(A,Y)$ be a [[Two Person Infinite Game of Perfect Information|Game]].
Suppose that $A$ is closed in the [[Game Space]] $\mathcal{F}(Y)$.
Then $\mathcal{G}(A,Y)$ is [[Determined]].
### Proof
Suppose `II` has no [[Winning Game Strategy]] for $\mathcal{G}=\mathcal{G}(A,Y)$.
There is a first move $y_{0}$ such that `II` has no [[Winning Game Strategy]] for $\mathcal{G}$ starting at $(y_{0})$.
Moreover, if `II` has no [[Winning Game Strategy]] for $\mathcal{G}$ starting at $(y_{0},\dots,y_{2n})$
then for any $y_{2n+1}$ there is a move $y_{2n+2}$ such that 
`II` has no [[Winning Game Strategy]] for $\mathcal{G}$ starting at $(y_{0},\dots,y_{2n},y_{2n+1},y_{2n+2})$.
