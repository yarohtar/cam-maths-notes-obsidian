Let $Y$ be a [[Game Tree]]. 
We define $\mathcal{F}(Y)$ to be the collection of all infinite sequences 
$$
(y_{0},y_{1},\dots)
$$
such that $(y_{0},y_{1},\dots,y_{n})\in Y$ for all $n\in \omega$.
The set $\mathcal{F}(Y)$ is called the Game Space. 
We define the [[Topological space|topology]] on $\mathcal{F}(Y)$ generated by base open sets of the form
$$
\{ x \in \mathcal{F}(Y) : p\text{ is an initial segment of }x \}
$$
for each $p\in Y$.
