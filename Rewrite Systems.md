Fix $\Omega$, a finite set of symbols.

$\alpha\in \Omega^+$, $\beta \in \Omega ^{*}$ then $\alpha\to \beta$ is called a rewrite rule (production rule)
So the set of rewrite rules is $\Omega^+\times \Omega ^{*}$ (this is countable)

### Definition
$(\Omega,P)$ is a rewrite system if $P$ is a finite set of rewrite rules.
### Proposition
If $\Omega$ is fixed, there are countably many rewrite systems on $\Omega$.
