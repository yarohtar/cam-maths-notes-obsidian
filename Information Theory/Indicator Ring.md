Let $X$ be a set and let $\{ 0,1 \}^{X}$ be the set of its indicator functions.
For any $A,B\subseteq X$ define the sum:
$$
1_{A}+1_{B} = 1_{A\triangle B}
$$
and the wedge product:
$$
1_{A}\wedge 1_{B} = 1_{A\cap B}
$$
Then $\{ 0,1 \}^{X}$ forms a [[Algebra/Ring Theory/Ring|Ring]] with these operations.
