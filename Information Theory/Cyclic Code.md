A code $C\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$ is a cyclic code if it is [[Linear Code]] and 
$$
(a_{0},\dots,a_{n-1})\in C\implies(a_{1},\dots,a_{n-1},a_{0})\in C
$$
We identify $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$ with the [[Ring]] $\mathbb{F}_{2}[X] / (X^{n}-1)$ via
$$
\pi(a_{0},a_{1},\dots,a_{n-1})\to a_{0}+a_{1}X+\dots+a_{n-1}X^{n-1} 
$$
### Lemma
A code $C$ is cyclic if and only if $\mathcal{C}=\pi(C)$ satisfies
1. $0\in \mathcal{C}$
2. $f,g\in \mathcal{C}$ then $f+g\in \mathcal{C}$
3. $f\in \mathcal{C}, g\in \mathbb{F}_{2}[X]\implies gf\in \mathcal{C}$
### Corollary
$C$ is a cyclic code of length $n$ if and only if $\mathcal{C}$ is an [[Ideal]] in $\mathbb{F}_{2}[X] / (X^{n}-1)$
We identify $C$ and $\mathcal{C}$.
### Lemma
$\mathbb{F}_{2}[X] /(X^{n}-1)$ is a [[Principal Ideal Domain]]
Moreover, each of its ideals is generated by some $g$ such that $g(X)\mid X^{n}-1$
#### Proof
Note that $\mathbb{F}_{2}[X] /(X^{n}-1)$ is [[Euclidean Domain]] 
so also [[Principal Ideal Domain]].
Now if $h(X)$ is coprime with $X^{n}-1$, then there is some $h'(X)\in \mathbb{F}_{2}[X]$ 
such that $h(X)h'(X)=1\pmod{X^{n}-1}$
So let $g(X)=h(X)g'(X)$ be a generator of an ideal.
Then $g'(X)=h'(X)g(X)$ is also in the ideal and divides the generator 
so $g'(X)$ is another generator. 
This way, we can get rid of factors of $g$ not dividing $X^{n}-1$.

### Corollary
We define the following
[[Generator Polynomial]]
[[Parity Check Polynomial]]
### Proposition
If $N$ is odd, $f(X)=X^{N}-1$ has no repeated roots so
$X^{N}-1=f_{1}(X)\dots f_{k}(X)$ where $f_{1},\dots,f_{k}$ are distinct irreducible polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_{2}[X]$ 
So number of cyclic codes of length $N$ is $2^{k}$
