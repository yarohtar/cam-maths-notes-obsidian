After receiving a word through a communication channel, 
we hope to recover the original message. 
We use a [[Decoding rule]] and analyse some properties of the channel.

We define two concepts:
[[Operational Channel Capacity]]
[[Information Channel Capacity]]

We prove they are the same in 
[[Shannon's noisy coding theorem (2nd coding theorem)]]

### Example
A [[Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC)]] with error probability $p$ has capacity $1-H(p)$.
#### Proof
Calculate [[Information Channel Capacity]].
