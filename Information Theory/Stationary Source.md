A [[Source]] $X_{1},X_{2},\dots$ is stationary if for each $n\geq 1$,
the distribution of $X_{k+1}^{k+n}$ is the same for all $k$.
### Theorem
If $X_{1},X_{2},\dots$ is a stationary source on a finite alphabet $A$,
then the [[Entropy Rate]] exists and is equal to 
$$
H(X) = \lim_{n\to \infty} H(X_{n}\mid X_{1}^{n-1})
$$
Moreover, we can express this as 
$$
H(X) = \lim_{n\to \infty}H(X_{0}\mid X_{-n}^{-1}) = H(X_{0}\mid X_{-\infty}^{-1})
$$
