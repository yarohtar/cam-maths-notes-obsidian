Let $X$ be a [[Random Variable]] taking values in a discrete set $A$
following a distribution
$$
p(x) = \mathbb{P}(X=x)
$$
The information content of $X$ is itself a [[Random Variable]]:
$$
I(X) = -\log p(X)
$$
where $p(X)$ is [[Random Probability of Random Variable]].

Note that improbable events have high information content.
