Let $\{ X_{n} \}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ be random variables taking values in alphabet $A$
and let $H\geq 0$
The sets of typical strings of length $n\in \mathbb{N}$ with constant $H$
are defined for each $\epsilon>0$ by:
$$
B_{n}^{*}(\epsilon)= \{ x_{1}^{n}\in A^{n} : 2^{-n(H+\epsilon)} \leq P^{n}(x_{1}^{n}) \leq 2^{-n(H-\epsilon)} \}
$$
where $P^{n}$ is the joint probability density function for $X_{1}^{n}=(X_{1},\dots,X_{n})$

Usually, $H$ is [[Mathematical Entropy]] and $X_{n}$ are IID.
