Let $p_{1},\dots,p_{n}$ and $q_{1},\dots,q_{n}$ be probability distributions.
Then 
$$
-\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}\log p_{i}\leq-\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i}\log q_{i}
$$
with equality iff $p_{i}=q_{i}$.
#### Proof
We can replace $\log$ by $\ln$ if we multiply through by $\ln 2$.
Note, $\ln x\leq x-1$ with equality iff $x=1$.

$\ln\left( \frac{q_{i}}{p_{i}} \right)\leq \frac{q_{i}}{p_{i}}-1$
Now multiply through and sum over 

Equality holds iff $\frac{q_{i}}{p_{i}}=1$
