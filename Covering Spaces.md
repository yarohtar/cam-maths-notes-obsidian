A covering space of a space $X$ is a pair $(\tilde{X}, p)$ where
- $\tilde{X}$ is a space
- $p: \tilde{X}\to X$ is a map such that for all $x \in X$ there is a [[Neighbourhood|nbd]] $U$ of $x$ such that $p ^{-1}(U)=\sqcup_{\alpha\in A}V_{\alpha}$, where $V_{\alpha}\subset \tilde X$ open, $p|_{V_{\alpha}}:V_{\alpha}\to U$ is a homeomorphism
$p$ is called a covering map. Open sets $U$ as above are called evenly covered.
