## Postulate I
States are vectors $\ket{\psi}$ in a [[Hilbert Spaces (PQM)|Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$.
## Postulate II
Observables are [[Linear Operators|linear]] [[Hermetian operator]] $Q:\mathcal{H}\to \mathcal{H}$.

Operators form an associative but not commutative algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ called the "Operator Algebra" where the product is the composition.
If there is a unique eigenvector for each eigenvalue of an operator $A$, then we label eigenvectors by their eigenvalues and write $A\ket{a}=a\ket{a}$. There is no confusion because the vectors are always in a ket.
