## Postulate I
States are vectors $\ket{\psi}$ in a [[Hilbert Spaces (PQM)|Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$.
## Postulate II
Observables are [[Linear Operators|linear]] [[Hermetian operator]] $Q:\mathcal{H}\to \mathcal{H}$.

Operators form an associative but not commutative algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ called the "Operator Algebra"
