For $X$ and $Y$ [[Normed Spaces]], a linear map $T:X\to Y$ is an operator if it is continuous.
### Proposition
Let $X$, $Y$ be normed, $T:X\to Y$. Then the following are equivalent:
1. $T$ is continuous
2. $T$ is continuous at $0$
3. There is a $k$ such that $\lVert Tx \rVert\leq k\lVert x \rVert$ for all $x \in X$
