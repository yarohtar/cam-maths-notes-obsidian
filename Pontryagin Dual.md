Let $G$ be a [[Group]].
The set of [[Character]]s of $G$ form a [[Group]],
called the Pontryagin dual of $G$.
### Proof
The trivial character $\chi_{0}$ takes everything to $1$.
It's easy to see that if $\chi_{1}$ and $\chi_{2}$ are characters, then so is $\chi_{1}\chi_{2}$.
The inverse is complex conjugate as:
$$
\overline{\chi}\chi=1=\chi_{0}
$$
