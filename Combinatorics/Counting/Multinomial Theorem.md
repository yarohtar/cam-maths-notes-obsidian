The multinomial expansion has the form:
$$
(x_{1}+\dots+x_{k})^{n}  = \sum_{n=a_{1}+\dots+a_{k}} \binom{ n }{ a_{1},\dots,a_{k} } x_{1}^{a_{1}}\dots x_{k}^{a_{k}} 
$$
This is the generalization of [[Binomial Theorem]] using [[Multinomial Coefficient]]s.

#### Proof
By definition of [[Multinomial Coefficient]] and counting.
