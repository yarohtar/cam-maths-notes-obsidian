Let $\{ S_{1},\dots,S_{m} \}$ be a family of subsets of $[n]$ such that $\lvert S_{i} \rvert$ is even for all $i$
and $\lvert S_{i}\cap S_{j} \rvert$ is even for all $i\neq j$.
Then
$$
m\leq 2^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor }
$$
### Proof
Consider the subspace $U$ of $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$ generated by $\chi_{S_{i}}$.
Observe that $U\subseteq U^{\bot}$, but since $\dim U^{\bot}=n-\dim U$, then $\dim U\leq \left\lfloor  \frac{n}{2}  \right\rfloor$ so: 
$$
\lvert U \rvert \leq 2^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor }
$$
### Remark
We get equality by partitioning $[n]$ into $\left\lfloor  \frac{n}{2}  \right\rfloor$ couples 
and taking all subsets of these couples.
If $n$ is odd, we can find a family of odd sets with all intersections odd.
