Let $G$ be a connected graph.
If $G$ is not an odd cycle or a complete graph then $\chi(G)\leq \Delta(G)$
### Proof
First $G$ is $\Delta$ regular by ordering vertices and greedy colouring
If $G$ is not $2$ connected, consider the cut vertex $x$ 
and let $G_{i}$ be a component of $G-x$ together with $x$
Then colour those components and combine
If $G$ is $3$ connected, pick $x\in G$
Pick $x_{1},x_{2}\in N(x)$ such that $x_{1}x_{2}$ are not connected
Then form the path $x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{n}$ and use greedy

If $G$ is $2$ connected ...
