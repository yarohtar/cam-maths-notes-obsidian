Given a [[Combinatorial Structure|Structure]] $\mathcal{A}=(A,v)$, with $v:A\to R[x]$ 
such that the [[Algebra/Ring Theory/Ring|Ring]] $R$ contains $\mathbb{Q}$,
its exponential generating function is a [[Formal Power Series]] in $R[[x]]$
$$
\tilde{f}_{\mathcal{A}}(x) = \sum_{\alpha \in A} v(\alpha)
$$
Note that this is well defined 
as there is only finitely many $\alpha \in A$ such that $\deg v(\alpha)= n$ for each $n$.
