Let $G=(V,E)$ be a [[Simple Graph|Graph]] and $k\in \mathbb{N}$.
Suppose that for any sets $S_{v}$ such that $\lvert S_{v} \rvert=k$ for all $v\in V$
we have that $G$ is $S$-[[List Colouring]].
Then $G$ is $k$-list-colourable.
The list chromatic number of $G$ is the smallest $k\in \mathbb{N}$
such that $G$ is $k$-list-colourable.
