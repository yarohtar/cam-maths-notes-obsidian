Observables in Quantum mechanics are represented by [[Linear Operators|linear]] [[Adjoint#Definition|Hermetian]] operators

Operators form an associative but not commutative algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ called the "Operator Algebra" where the product is the composition.
If there is a unique eigenvector for each eigenvalue of an operator $A$, then we label eigenvectors by their eigenvalues and write $A\ket{a}=a\ket{a}$. There is no confusion because the vectors are always in a ket.
