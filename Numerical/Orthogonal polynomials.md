Given an inner product $(\cdot,\cdot)$ 
there is a unique set of monic orthogonal polynomials $\{p_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ 
such that $\deg(p_k)=k$. 
We find them by the [[Gram-Schmidt process]], 
and uniqueness of $p_k$ obtained by contradiction and looking at roots.

### Three step recurrence
Consider an inner product s.t. $(xf,g)=(f,xg)$. 
Then we have a three-step recurrence:
$$p_{-1}(x)=0\quad\quad p_0(x)=1$$
$$p_{n+1}(x)=(x-\alpha_n)p_n(x)-\beta_np_{n-1}(x)$$
where
$$
\alpha_n = {(p_n,xp_n)\over (p_n,p_n)}\quad\quad \beta_n={(p_n,p_n)\over (p_{n-1},p_{n-1})}
$$

## Least squares polynomial approximation
Given a function $f$, 
suppose we want to minimize $(f-p,f-p)$, 
where $p$ is a polynomial of degree $n$. 
We claim this is always:
$$
p(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n{(f,p_k)\over (p_k,p_k)}p_k
$$
