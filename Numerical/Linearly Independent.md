Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] over a [[Field]] $F$
and let $v_{1},v_{2},\dots,v_{n}\in V$
We say that $v_{1},\dots,v_{n}$ are linearly independent if:
$$
\lambda_{1}v_{1} + \lambda_{2}v_{2} + \dots + \lambda_{n}v_{n}=0 \implies \lambda_{1}=\lambda_{2}=\dots=\lambda_{n}=0
$$
for all $\lambda_{1},\dots,\lambda_{n}\in F$.
In other words, no nontrivial [[Linear Combination]] of linearly independent vectors is $0$
