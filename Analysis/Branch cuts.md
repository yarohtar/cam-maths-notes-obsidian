A branch point of $f$ is a point which cannot be encircled by a curve such that $f$ is single valued and continuous. 
Ex $\log z$ has branchpoints at $z=0$ and $z=\infty$.

A branch cut is a line that we exclude from our domain.

Let $f$ have some branchpoints. A complete branch cut of $f$ is a set of cuts s.t. every branchpoint has a cut ending in it; both ends of each cut end on a branch point; any curve in $\mathbb C$ that doesn't intersect the branch cut encloses either all or none of the branchpoints.
