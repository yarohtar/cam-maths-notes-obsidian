For a metric space $M$, the following are equivalent:
1. $M$ is [[Compact]]
2. $M$ is [[Sequentially compact]]
3. $M$ is [[Totally bounded]] and [[Complete|complete]]

## Proof(s)
$(1\implies 2):$ Suppose $M$ is compact. 
Suppose it is not sequentially compact. 
Find a sequence $(x_n)$ which doesn't have a convergent subsequence. 
Suppose that there is some $x\in M$ 
s.t. every nbd $U$ of $x$ 
has infinitely many points of the sequence. 
Now there must be a subsequence of $(x_n)$ converging to $x$ - contradiction. 
Hence, for every $x\in M$ 
find open nbd $U_x$ of $x$ 
which contains at most finitely many points in the sequence. 
Then $U_x$ are an open cover of $M$. 
But $M$ is compact, 
so find finite $F\subseteq M$ s.t. $\bigcup_{x\in F}U_x=M$. 
Hence, this union contains at most finitely many points of the sequence, 
but there are infinitely many of them in $M$ - contradiction.

$(2\implies 3):$ Suppose $M$ is sequentially compact. 
Take any Cauchy sequence. 
It has a convergent subsequence. 
But that convergent subsequence will bind our Cauchy sequence, 
so the Cauchy sequence converges, 
hence $M$ is complete.
Now suppose $M$ is not totally bounded. 
Find an $\epsilon$ s.t. every $\epsilon$-net is infinite. 
Pick any point $x_0\in M$ and keep picking $x_{n+1}\not\in\bigcup_{k=1}^nB_\epsilon(x_k)$ 
(always possible because finitely many points can't cover $M$). 
Now find a convergent subsequence of this 
but the sequence is not Cauchy! 
And a convergent sequence is always Cauchy! 
Contradiction.

$(3\implies 2):$ Suppose $M$ is totally bounded and complete. 
Pick a sequence $(x_n)$ in $M$. 
Let $N_0=\mathbb N$. 
For any $k\in\mathbb N$ let $\epsilon=1/k$ and find a finite $\epsilon$-net. 
One of the balls in it will contain infinitely many terms of the sequence $(x_n)_{n\in N_{k-1}}$, 
so let $N_k\subseteq N_{k-1}\setminus\{\min N_{k-1}\}$ be this infinite set contained in this ball.
Hence define $n_k=\min N_k$. 
Then the sequence $(x_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb N}$ is Cauchy 
(for any $\epsilon>0$, the sequence $(x_{n_k})_{k>1/\epsilon}$ is contained in a ball of radius $\epsilon$) 
hence convergent. 

$(2\implies 1):$ Suppose $M$ is sequentially compact. 
Because of $(2\implies 3)$ we have already proved that $M$ is totally bounded and complete. 
Let $\mathcal U$ be an open cover of $M$.
Use [[Lebesgue number lemma]] to find a $\delta>0$
Find a finite $\delta$-net. 
By definition of $\delta$, 
find $B_\delta(a_i)\subseteq G_i\in\mathcal U$ for each $a_i$ in the $\delta$-net. 
Then $G_i$ cover $M$.
Hence $M$ is compact.
