Let $S$ be a [[Convex Set]]
Let $x\in S$
We say that $x$ is an extreme point of $S$ if 
for all $\lambda \in(0,1)$ and $y,z\in S$:
$$
x=\lambda y + (1-\lambda)z \implies x=y=z
$$
Think of $x$ as a corner, or a point on a non-straight edge of $S$.
Note that $x$ cannot be in the interior of a straight edge of $S$.
