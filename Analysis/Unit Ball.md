$B=\{x\in X : ||x||\leq 1\}$

Can check that $B$ is closed, bounded, convex, symmetric and a neighbourhood of 0.
Suppose $B'$ does satisfy this, then $B'$ defines a norm by taking
$||x||=\inf\left\{  \alpha\geq 0 \mid \frac{x}{\alpha}\in B'  \right\}$

### Theorem
Let $X$ be an $\infty$-dimensional normed space. Then there are some $(x_{n})\in X$ with $\lVert x_{n} \rVert=1$ for all $n$ and $\lVert x_{n}-x_{m} \rVert\geq 1$ for all $n,m$. In particular, $B_{X}$ is not complete.
