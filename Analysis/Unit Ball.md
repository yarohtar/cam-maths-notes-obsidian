Let $X$ be a [[Normed Space]].
The unit ball of $X$ is:
$$
B=\{x\in X : ||x||\leq 1\}
$$
Can check that $B$ is closed, bounded, convex, symmetric and a neighbourhood of 0.
### Lemma
Let $X$ be a [[Vector Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.
If $B'\subseteq X$ is closed, bounded, convex, symmetric and a [[Neighbourhood]] of $0$
then $B'$ defines a [[Norm]] by taking:
$$
||x||=\inf\left\{  \alpha\geq 0 \mid \frac{x}{\alpha}\in B'  \right\}
$$
Furthermore, $B'$ is the unit ball in this norm.

### Theorem
Let $X$ be an $\infty$-dimensional [[Normed Space]]. 
Then there are some $(x_{n})\in X$ with $\lVert x_{n} \rVert=1$ for all $n$ and $\lVert x_{n}-x_{m} \rVert\geq 1$ for all $n,m$. 
In particular, $B_{X}$ is not [[Complete]].
