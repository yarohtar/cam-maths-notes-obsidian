Let $M$ be a [[Metric space]] with distance function $d$
We say that a sequence $x_{n}$ in $M$ is Cauchy if
for every $\epsilon>0$ there is some $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that 
for all $n,m>N$:
$$
d(x_{n},x_{m}) < \epsilon
$$
### Lemma
Every [[Convergence|convergent]] sequence is Cauchy.
### Lemma


## Theorem
A real sequence $x_n\in \mathbb{R}$ is convergent 
if and only if
$x_{n}$ is Cauchy.
### Proof
We only need one direction.
and then use [[Boltzano-Weierstrass theorem#Real sequences]]
