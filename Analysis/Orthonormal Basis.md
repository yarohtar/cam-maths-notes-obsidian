Let $X$ be an [[Inner Product Space]]. 
A sequence $(x_{n})$ is an orthonormal basis if:
1. it is an [[Orthonormal Sequence]]
2. The span $\langle x_{n}:n=1,2,\dots \rangle$ is dense in $X$ 

We use the same terminology for a finite sequence
[[Gram-Schmidt process]] applies

### Corollary
Let $X$ be a [[Separable Space]] [[Inner Product Space]]. 
Then $X$ has an orthonormal basis.

### Corollary
Let $X$ be an $n$-dimensional inner product space. 
Then $X$ has a [[Isometric Isomorphism]] to $l_{2}^{n}$.
