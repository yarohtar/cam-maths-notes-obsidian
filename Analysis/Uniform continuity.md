We say $f:U\to \mathbb C$ is uniformly continuous if 
$\forall \epsilon>0,\exists \delta>0,\forall x,y\in U$
$$|x-y|<\delta \implies |f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$$
Note that the difference from regular continuity is that $\delta$ doesn't depend on $x$.

### Theorem
If $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$ then it is uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$.
#### Proof sketch
Suppose otherwise. Choose a "bad" $\epsilon$ and $\delta_n=\frac 1 n$, along with $x_n,y_n$. Use [[Boltzano-Weierstrass theorem|BWT]] to find convergent $x_{k_n}\to x$ (which has to stay in the closed interval). Then also $y_{k_n}\to x$. Now find a contradiction with continuity at $x$.

### Theorem 
If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ then it is integrable on $[a,b]$.
#### Proof sketch
By previous theorem, $f$ is uniformly continuous. Now choose a dissection $D=x_1<x_2<\dots<x_n$ s.t. $x_{i+1}-x_i<\delta$. Write out $U$ and $L$ and bind them appropriately - done.
