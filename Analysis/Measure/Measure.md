Let $(E,\mathcal{E})$ be a [[Measurable Space]]
Let $\mu:\mathcal{E}\to[0,\infty]$ be a [[Countably Additive Set Function]] i.e.
- $\mu(\emptyset)=0$
- for any sequence $(A_{n})$ of disjoint elements of $\mathcal{E}$:
$$
\mu\left( \bigcup_{n} A_{n} \right) = \sum_{n} \mu(A_{n})
$$
Then $\mu$ is called a measure.
The triple $(E,\mathcal{E},\mu)$ is called a [[Measure Space]]
