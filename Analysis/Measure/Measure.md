Let $(E,\mathcal{E})$ be a [[Measurable Space]]
Let $\mu:\mathcal{E}\to[0,\infty]$ be a function satisfying:
- $\mu(\emptyset)=0$
- for any sequence $(A_{n})$ of disjoint elements of $\mathcal{E}$:
$$
\mu\left( \bigcup_{n} A_{n} \right) = \sum_{n} \mu(A_{n})
$$
Then $\mu$ is called a measure.

[[Finite Measure]]
[[Probability Measure]]

The triple $(E,\mathcal{E},\mu)$ is called a measure space.

### Properties
- If $\mu(E)=1$ then $\mu$ is a probability measure 
  and $(E,\mathcal{E},\mu)$ is a [[Probability Space]], often denoted  by $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$
- If $\mu(E)<\infty$, then $\mu$ is a finite measure
- If there exists a sequence of sets $(E_{n})$ in $\mathcal{E}$ with $\bigcup_{n}E_{n}=E$
  and $\mu(E_{n})<\infty$ for all $n$ then $\mu$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure
