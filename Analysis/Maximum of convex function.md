Formalizing the idea that the max of convex function has to be on a boundary.

### Theorem
Let $S$ be a [[Convex Set]]
Let $f:S\to \mathbb{R}$ be a [[Convex Function]]
Maximum of $f$ is then an [[Extreme point of convex set]] of $S$
#### Proof
Suppose $x$ is not an extreme point of $S$. 
Then $x=\lambda y+(1-\lambda)z$ for distinct $y\neq x$ and $z\neq x$. 
Then $f(x)\leq \lambda f(y)+(1-\lambda)f(z)$, so
