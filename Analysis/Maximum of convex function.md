Formalizing the idea that the max of convex function has to be on a boundary.

### Theorem
Maximum of a convex function on a convex set $S$ is [[Extreme point of convex set]] of $S$.
#### Proof
Suppose $x$ is not an extreme point of $S$. Then $x=\lambda y+(1-\lambda)z$ for distinct $y\neq x$ and $z\neq x$. Then $f(x)\leq \lambda f(y)+(1-\lambda)f(z)$, so
