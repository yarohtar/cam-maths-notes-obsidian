Let $X$ be a complex [[Banach Space]], $T\in L(X)$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$
Then $\lambda$ is an approximate eigenvalue if 
for all $\epsilon>0$ there is some $x\in X$ with $\lVert x \rVert=1$ such that $\lVert Tx-\lambda x \rVert<\epsilon$.

Equivalently, there is a sequence $(x_{n})$ in $X$ such that $\lVert x_{n} \rVert=1$ and $\lVert Tx_{n}-\lambda x_{n} \rVert\to 0$
Such a sequence is called an approximate eigenvector of $T$

### Proposition
1. $\lambda$ is an [[Eigenvalue]] of $T$ $\implies \lambda$ is an approximate eigenvalue
2. $\lambda$ is an approximate eigenvalue $\implies \lambda \in \sigma(T)$ [[Spectrum]]
