Let $S$ be a [[Compact]] [[Convex Set]].
Let $f:S\to \mathbb{R}$ be a [[Continuous]] [[Convex Function]].
Then $f$ achieves its maximum at an [[Extreme Point]] of $S$.

### Proof
Let $m=\max(f(S))$.
It exists as $S$ is [[Compact]] and $f$ is [[Continuous]]
Now set
$$
U=\{ x\in S : f(x) < m\}
$$
As $f$ is [[Continuous]], $U$ is open (in $S$)
As $f$ is a [[Convex Function]], $U$ is a [[Convex Set]].
Suppose $U$ contains all [[Extreme Point]]s of $S$ 

TODO
Somewhere here, there is a proof that $U=S$, but I can't find it rn.
