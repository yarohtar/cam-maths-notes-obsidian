The residue of $f$ at an isolated singularity $z=z_0$ is the coefficient $a_{-1}$ in the [[Laurent series]] expansion of $f$ around $z_0$.

Suppose $f$ has a pole of order $n$ at $z=z_0$.
Then:
$$\mathop{\mathrm{Re}s}_{z=z_0}f=\lim_{z\to z_0}\frac 1 {(n-1)!}{d^{n-1}\over dz^{n-1}}(z-z_0)^nf(z)$$
Proof directly from [[Laurent series]] expansion.
