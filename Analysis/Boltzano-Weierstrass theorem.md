## Real sequences
### Theorem
Let $x_n$ be a bounded real sequence. Then $x_n$ contains a convergent subsequence.

#### Proof
By considering half intervals. Alternatively, can use increasing bounded sequence converges property.

## $R^n$ sequences
### Theorem
Same statement as for Real sequences

#### Proof
To prove it, first find a subsequence such that the first coordinate converges. Then find the subsequence of that subsequence s.t. the second coordinate converges....
