$[0,1]$ is compact.
#### Proof sketch 
Suppose otherwise, and pick a cover which has no finite subcover. 
Find sequence of intervals each half of the previous one which cannot be covered by a finite subcover. 
The limit is some $x$ which is certainly in one of the open sets in the cover. 
But then that set will contain one of the intervals which is a contradiction.
