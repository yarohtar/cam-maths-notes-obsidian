For stuff of form:
$a\partial_{xx}u+2b\partial_{xy}u+c\partial_{yy}u+(1st\ order)=...$ find characteristics in terms of $z=dy/dx$ s.t. 
$$az^2+2bz+c=0$$
Let $\xi(x,y)$ and $\eta(x,y)$ be coordinates along these characteristics, our equation will transform to $\partial_{\xi\eta}u+(1st\ order)=...$
(note that we can't do much if theres only one sol...)
