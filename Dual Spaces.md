The dual of $X$ is $X^{*}=L(X,\mathbb{R})$ the set of all linear functionals from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$.

### Definition
For normed spaces $X$ and $Y$, an isomorphism from $X$ to $Y$ is a map $T:X\to Y$ that is a linear homeomorphism

### Theorem
A linear bijection is an isomorphism.

### Theorem
$X$, $Y$ normed with $Y$ complete. Then $L(X,Y)$ is complete. In particular, $X^{*}$ is complete.
#### Proof
Given $(T_{n})$ Cauchy in $L(X,Y)$:
Have $(T_{n}x)$ Caucy
