Let $Y$ be a [[Game Tree]] and $X$ be a `I`-[[Imposed Subgame Tree]] of $Y$.
Let $\mathcal{F}(Y)$ and $\mathcal{F}(X)$ be [[Game Space]]s for $Y$ and $X$ respectively.
Given a game $\mathcal{G}(A,Y)$, where $A\subseteq \mathcal{F}(Y)$, 
we say that $X$ is a winning subgame tree if every play in $\mathcal{G}(A',X)$ leads to victory for `I`,
where $A'=Aca$
Suppose every play of the [[Two Person Infinite Game of Perfect Information|Game]] $\mathcal{G}(A,X)$
