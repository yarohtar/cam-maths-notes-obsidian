This is an Obsidian Vault that I used to organize my notes on various Part IB and Part II courses. Part IB notes were created during Easter term when this project started, while Part II is being created as lectures go. 

None of this is official and it is not an accurate representation of what was lectured. I tend to give more attention to the things that I found difficult, while I might omit things that I already knew. 

this is a change made in the main repository
this is a second change made in the main repository
hmmm lets see what happens 

## How to view
Firstly download the Obsidian app from the official website https://obsidian.md/

### The easy way
On github, click Code > Download ZIP and save it.

Extract the file anywhere you want (make sure it is all contained in one directory - this should be true by default)

Now open Obsidian, select Open folder as vault and navigate to the folder you extracted. 

You should be good to go.

If you're prompted to install plugins, they aren't essential, but a few files will not display correctly without them

## How to navigate
In the top right corner, you can switch between reading and editing modes.

what about this?

Pressing CTRL+O (CMD+O on Mac) you can type in the name of the course you're interested in. If the course is in the database, you'll find its initial file, usually an index of topics. Now you can click on links (CTRL/CMD + Click to open in new tab) and read.

and also change stuff here what happens?

This is a change made in the cloned repository
