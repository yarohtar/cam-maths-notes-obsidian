This is an Obsidian Vault that I used to organize my notes on various Part IB and Part II courses. Part IB notes were created during Easter term when this project started, while Part II is being created as lectures go. 

None of this is official and it is not an accurate representation of what was lectured. I tend to give more attention to the things that I found difficult, while I might omit things that I already knew. 

You're welcome to fork this and add your own changes / notes, but if you only want to read see 

WARNING: If you clone this and add your own changes, and then pull changes from this repo, the obsidian git plugin sometimes gets very confused about merging. You should use command line git in this case.
