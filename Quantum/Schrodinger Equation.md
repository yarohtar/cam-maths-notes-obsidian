#### TDSE
$$i\hbar {\partial \psi \over \partial t} = \hat H\psi =  -{\hbar^2 \over2m}\nabla^2\psi+U\cdot\psi$$
where $\hat H$ is the Hamiltonian operator. 

#### TISE
Set $\psi = X(x)\cdot T(t)$ and find:
$$i\hbar T'=ET$$
$$\hat H X = E X$$
Hence $\psi = X(x) \cdot e^{-\frac {iEt} \hbar}$ where $E$ is an eigenvalue of $\hat H$ and $X$ is a corresponding eigenfunction. These are called stationary states (their probability distribution doesn't depend on time: $|\psi|^2$ is constant).
