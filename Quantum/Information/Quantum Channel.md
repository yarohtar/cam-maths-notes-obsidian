A quantum channel is a [[Completely Positive]], [[Trace]] preserving, [[Linear Operator]]:
$$
T:\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{H}_{1})\to \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{H}_{2})
$$
where $\mathcal{S}$ is the space of [[Density Operator|Quantum State]]s

### Theorem
Any quantum channel is a combination of: 
- [[Unitary]] evolution $\rho \to U^{\dagger}\rho U$
- Adding an ancilla $\rho \to \rho \otimes \rho_{E}$
- [[Partial Trace]]
