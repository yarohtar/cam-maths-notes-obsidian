The [[Dual Space|dual]] $\mathcal H^*$ of $\mathcal H$ is the space of linear maps $f:\mathcal H\to \mathbb C$

For finite dimensional case, given $\phi\in\mathcal H$ we have the map $f_\phi(\cdot)=(\phi,\cdot)$ and this is all of them and here $\mathcal H = \mathcal H^*$

For infinite dimensional space this is only true for continuous maps ([[Analysis of Functions]])

Example: $\delta :\mathcal H\to \mathbb C$ where $\psi(x)\to \psi(0)$ but $||\delta(x)||^2=\delta(0)$ so it certainly cannot lie in our $\mathcal{H}$.
