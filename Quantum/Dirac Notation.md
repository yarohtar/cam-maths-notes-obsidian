If $\psi \in \mathcal H$ we put it in a "Ket": $\ket{\psi}$ 
If $\phi\in \mathcal H^*$ we put it in a "Bra": $\bra{\phi}$

The inner product is bra-ket: $\phi(\psi)=\text{"}\phi^*\cdot \psi\text{"}=\braket{ \phi | \psi }$

Think of Ket as vertical vector, bra as horizontal vector of complex conjugates and then braket as matrix product.
Note that we can't represent all elements of $\mathcal{H}^{*}$ like this, for example the Dirac $\delta$ is not a bra of any vector.
