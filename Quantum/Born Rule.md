Probability of finding a particle in state $\ket{i}$ where 
$$
\ket{ \psi} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_{i}\ket{i}
$$
is $\lvert a_{i} \rvert ^{2}$. (given that the basis is orthonormal)

#### Extended Born Rule
Additionally, if $H$ is a subspace given by the orthonormal basis 
then the probability of particle being in $H$ is just the sum of squares of coefs.
