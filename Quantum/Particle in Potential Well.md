Generally set $\psi = X T$, 
and solve the [[Schrodinger Equation]] in the relevant intervals, 
assuming necessary continuity conditions. 
## Infinite Well
Assume $X=0$ when $U=\infty$. 
Only assume continuity for $X$.

### Finite Well
Assume continuity for both $X$ and $X'$. 
Also assume $X$ decays as $x\to\pm\infty$.
