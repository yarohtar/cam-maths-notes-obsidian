A [[Cardinal]] $\kappa$ is called regular if 
$$
\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)=\kappa
$$
where $\mathrm{cf}$ is as in [[Cofinal]].
### Lemma
A [[Cardinal]] $\kappa$ is regular
if and only if
for any $\lambda<\kappa$, $\kappa$ is not the union of $\lambda$ many sets of cardinality $<\kappa$
### Lemma
Assuming [[Axiom of Choice]], all successor cardinals are regular.
