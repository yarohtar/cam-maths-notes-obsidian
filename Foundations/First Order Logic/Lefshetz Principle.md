Let $\varphi$ be a $\mathcal{L}$-[[Sentence]].
Then the following are equivalent:
$$
\mathrm{ACF}_{0} \models \varphi
$$
if and only if
$\mathrm{ACF}_{0}\cup \{ \varphi \}$ has a [[Model]]
if and only if
There is some $n>0$ such that $\mathrm{ACF}_{p}\models \varphi$ for every $p>n$
if and only if
For all $n>0$ there is some $p>n$ such that $\mathrm{ACF}_{p}\cup \{ \varphi \}$ has a [[Model]].
