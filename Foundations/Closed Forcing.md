A [[Forcing Partial Order]] is called $\lambda$-closed 
if for every $\gamma<\lambda$ and every strictly descending chain 
$$
\{ p_{\xi} : \xi<\gamma \}
$$
there is some $q\in \mathbb{P}$ such that 
$$
(\forall \xi<\gamma)\, q\leq p_{\xi}
$$
### Lemma
Everything is $\aleph_{0}$-closed (but that's not very interesting).
However, [[Finite Function Forcing]] $\mathrm{Fn}(X,2)$ is not $\aleph_{1}$-closed.
BUT $\mathrm{Fn}(X,2,\aleph_{1})$ is $\aleph_{1}$
