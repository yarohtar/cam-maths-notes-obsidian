Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a [[Language]].
We define the following
### $\Delta_{0}$
is the smallest class of formulae which
- contains all atomic formulae
- [[Closed Under Bounded Quantification]]
- Closed under $\land$, $\lor$, $\neg$, $\implies$
### $\Sigma_{1}$
A formula is $\Sigma_{1}$ if it is of the form
$$
\exists v_{1}\dots \exists v_{n} \, \phi
$$
for $\phi \in \Delta_{0}$
### $\Pi_{1}$
A formula is $\Pi_{1}$ if it is of the form
$$
\forall v_{1}\dots \forall v_{n} \,\phi
$$
for $\phi \in \Delta_{0}$
### $\Delta_{1}$
A formula is $\Delta_{1}$ if it is both $\Sigma_{1}$ and $\Pi_{1}$.

### Definition
If $T$ is any [[Theory]], and $S$ a class of formulas,
define $S^{T}$ to be the class of formulas that are equivalent in $T$
to a formula in $S$.
## Theorem
$\Delta_{0}^{T}$ formulas are [[Absolute]] for [[Transitive Model]]s of $T$.
#### Proof
By induction on the formula complexity in $\Delta_{0}$
we prove the statement for $\Delta_{0}$.
Then we easily extend to $\Delta_{0}^{T}$.
## Corollary
$\Sigma_{1}^{T}$ formulas are [[Upwards Absolute]] for [[Transitive Model]]s of $T$,
while $\Pi_{1}^{T}$ are [[Downwards Absolute]].
## Corollary
$\Delta_{1}^{T}$ formulas are [[Absolute]] for [[Transitive Model]]s of $T$.
