Tries to answer [[The Continuum Problem]]
The size of $\lvert \mathbb{R} \rvert$ is the smallest possible!
In other words:
$$
2^{\aleph_{0}} = \aleph_{1}
$$
### Theorem (GÃ¶del)
We can't refute the Continuum Hypothesis.
More precisely, if [[Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory]] is consistent
then
$$
ZFC\not \vdash \neg CH
$$

### Theorem (Cohen)
We can't prove the Continuum Hypothesis.
More precisely, if [[Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory]] is consistent
then
$$
ZFC \not \vdash CH
$$
