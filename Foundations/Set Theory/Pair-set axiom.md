For any sets $x$, $y$, can form $\{ x,y \}$
$$
(\forall x)(\forall y)(\exists z)(\forall t)(t\in z \iff(t=x\lor t=y))
$$
The unique (by (Ext)) is denoted by $\{ x,y \}$
We write $\{ x \}$ for $\{ x,x \}$
Formally, we introduced a binary symbol $\{ , \}$ and a unary symbol $\{  \}$
By (Ext) we have $\{ x,y \}=\{ y,x \}$
We can now define [[Ordered Pair]] and [[Function]]
