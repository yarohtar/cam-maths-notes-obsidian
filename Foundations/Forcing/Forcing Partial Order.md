Let $(\mathbb{P},\leq)$ be a [[Partial Order]] and $\mathbb{1}\in \mathbb{P}$ be the maximal element.
Then $(\mathbb{P},\leq,\mathbb{1})$ is called a forcing.

A subset $P\subseteq \mathbb{P}$ is said to be open if 
$$

$$
We equip $\mathbb{P}$ with open sets given by $\{ q:q\leq p \}$ for each $p \in \mathbb{P}$.
This allows us to talk about [[Dense]] subsets of $\mathbb{P}$.
