Let $\mathcal{L}_{\in}$ be the [[Language]] of set theory.
Fix $M$ a countable [[Transitive Model]].
Let $\mathbb{P}\in M$ be [[Forcing Partial Order]].
Add all [[Name]]s in $\mathrm{Name}^{\mathbb{P}}\cap M$ as constant symbols to $\mathcal{L}_{\in}$.
The new language obtained is the forcing language, denoted by $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{P},M}$.
