A class of formulas $\Gamma$ in a [[Language]] $\mathcal{L}$ is
closed under bounded quantification
if for any $\phi \in \Gamma$:
- $(\exists x\in y)\phi \in \Gamma$
- $(\forall x\in y)\phi \in \Gamma$
where $x\in y$ is some bound depending on the [[Language]] $\mathcal{L}$
In set theory, it means exactly $x\in y$.
In [[Peano Arithmetic]] it could mean $x<y$
