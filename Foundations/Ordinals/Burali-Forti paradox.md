The [[Ordinal]]s do not form a set. 
#### Proof
Assume that $X$ is a set consisting of all ordinals
$X$ is [[Well-Ordered]] by $<$
Let $\alpha$ be the [[Order Type]] of $X$
So $\alpha \in X$, and $I_{\alpha}$ is a proper [[Initial Segment]] of $X$ of order type $\alpha$, so $I_{\alpha}$ is [[Order-isomorphic]] to $X$ which is a contradiction.
