Let $\mathcal{L}$ be any [[Language]].
Let $M$ and $N$ be $\mathcal{L}$-[[Foundations/First Order Logic/Structure|Structures]]
such that $M$ is a [[Substructure]] of $N$.
Let $\Phi$ be a set of $\mathcal{L}$-formulas closed under subformulas.
Then all formulas in $\Phi$ are [[Absolute]] between $M$ and $N$ 
if and only if
for any formula $\exists x\,\phi \in \Phi$ where $\phi$ has $n+1$ [[Free Variable]]s including $x$
and for any $m_{1},\dots,m_{n}\in M$ such that $N\models \exists x\,\phi(m_{1},\dots,m_{n})$
there is some $m\in M$ such that 
$$
N\models \phi(m,m_{1},\dots,m_{n})
$$
### Proof
By induction on formula complexity. 
We only need to check formulas $\exists x\ \phi \in \Phi$ where $\phi$ is [[Absolute]].
Note that this is already [[Upwards Absolute]].
Now suppose that $N\models \exists x\ \phi(x,m_{1},\dots,m_{n})$
for some $m_{1},\dots,m_{n}\in M$. 
By assumption, there is some $m\in M$ such that 
$$
N\models \phi(m,m_{1},\dots,m_{n})
$$
By [[Absolute]]ness of $\phi$, then also
$$
M\models \phi(m,m_{1},\dots,m_{n})
$$
So, as $m\in M$, we are done:
$$
M\models (\exists x)\phi(x,m_{1},\dots,m_{n})
$$
