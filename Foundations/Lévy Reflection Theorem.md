If $\alpha \to Z_{\alpha}$ is a [[Hierarchy]] and $\phi$ any formula then
for any $\gamma$ there is some $\nu>\gamma$ 
such that $\phi$ is absolute between $Z_{\nu}$ and $Z$
### Corollary
For every $T\subseteq ZFC$ finite,
there is a [[Transitive Model]] $M\models T$.
#### Proof
Consider the [[Von Neumann Hierarchy]] $\alpha \to V_{\alpha}$ with $V$ the set theoretic universe.
Let $T$ be finite and $\phi$ a formula equivalent to $T$ (just $\land$ all formulas)
Then $\phi$ is true as $T\subseteq ZFC$.
