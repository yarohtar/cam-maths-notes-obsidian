We prove that if $M\models ZFC$ then there is a [[Transitive Model]] $N\subseteq M$
such that 
$$
N\models ZFC+CH
$$
where $CH$ is [[The Continuum Hypothesis]]:
$$
2^{\aleph_{0}}=\aleph_{1}
$$
[[Sufficiently Strong]]
[[Absoluteness of Truth in a Model]]

### Proof
Let $L$ be the [[Constructible Hierarchy]].
We want to prove that
$$
L\models ZF(C)
$$
Any [[Transitive Model]] satisfies [[Axiom of Extensionality]] and [[Axiom of Foundation]].
Also $X=\omega$ is [[Absolute]], and $\omega$ satisfies [[Axiom of Infinity]],
we also get $L_{\alpha}\models$[[Axiom of Infinity]] for all $\alpha>\omega$.
The operations $x,y\to \{ x,y \}$ and $x\to \bigcup x$ are [[Absolute Operation]]
for a [[Sufficiently Strong]] $T$.
So we only need to find 
$$
(\forall x,y\in L) \left( \{ x,y \}\in L \land \bigcup x\in L \right)
$$
