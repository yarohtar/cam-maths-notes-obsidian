We prove that if $M\models ZFC$ then there is a [[Transitive Model]] $N\subseteq M$
such that 
$$
N\models ZFC+CH
$$
where $CH$ is [[The Continuum Hypothesis]]:
$$
2^{\aleph_{0}}=\aleph_{1}
$$
## Proof
Let $L$ be the [[Constructible Hierarchy]].
Note that 
$$
L\models ZFC
$$
by [[Countable Model of Set Theory]] and [[Consistency of Choice]].
Furthermore $L$ is a [[Transitive Model]] of $ZFC$.

### Claim
For every $x\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, $x\in L$, there is some $\alpha<\omega_{1}$ such that $x\in L_{\alpha}$.
