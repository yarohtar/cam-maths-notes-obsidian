A set of formulas $T$ in a [[Language]] $L$ is sufficiently strong 
if $T$ proves the [[Absolute]]ness of all relevant formulas.
### Lemma
For finitely many relevant formulas,
we can always find a finite sufficiently strong $T$.
#### Proof
If $T'$ proves the [[Absolute]]ness of $\phi$,
then by [[Compactness Theorem]] there is a finite $T\subseteq T'$ that does.
