We say that $\mathcal{G}$ is a detecting family in a [[Category]] $\mathcal{C}$
if $\mathcal{C}(G,-)$ collectively reflect isomorphisms 
i.e. if $f:A\to B$ is such that every $h:G\to B$ with $G\in \mathcal{G}$
factors uniquely through $f$ (a unique $g:A\to G$ such that $hg=f$)
then $f$ is an [[Isomorphism]].

If $\mathcal{G}=\{ G \}$ we say $G$ is a detector.
