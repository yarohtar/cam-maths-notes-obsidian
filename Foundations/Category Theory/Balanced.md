Suppose that in a [[Category]] $\mathcal{C}$ we have:
[[Monomorphism]] $+$ [[Epimorphism]] $\implies$ [[Isomorphism]]
Then we say that $\mathcal{C}$ is balanced.

[[Category of Groups]].
In [[Category of Rings]], [[Monomorphism]]s are injective (use $\mathbb{Z}[X]$)
but $\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Q}$ is [[Epimorphism]] as well as [[Monomorphism]], 
so $\mathrm{Rng}$ is not balanced.

In a [[Preorder Category]], 
every [[Morphism]] is [[Monomorphism]] and [[Epimorphism]],
so a preorder is balanced
if and only if
it is a [[Groupoid]].
