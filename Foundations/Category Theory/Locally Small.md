A [[Category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is locally small if, for any two [[Object]]s $A$ and $B$,
the [[Morphism]]s $A\to B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ are parametrized by a set $\mathcal{C}(A,B)$.

These sets are sometimes called [[Hom-Set]]s.
They give rise to [[Hom-Functor]]s.

For example, $\mathrm{Set}$, $\mathrm{Gp}$, $\mathrm{Top}$ are all locally small
but [[Functor]] category $[\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}]$ needn't be.
