Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[Category]].
Let $A\in \operatorname{ob}\mathcal{C}$.
The generalized element of $A$ of shape $S$ is a [[Morphism]]
$$
f:S\to A
$$

### Example
In [[Category of Sets]] $\mathrm{Set}$, a generalized element of shape $1$ 
is just a function that picks one element of $A$ i.e.
$$
f:1\to A
$$
where $f(0)\in A$.
An ordered pair in $A$ is a generalized element of shape $2$ etc.

A subset of $A$ is a generalized element of $2$ of shape $A$.
