Suppose [[Category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is such that for any objects $A$ and $B$
there is at most one morphism $A\to B$
Then $\operatorname{mor}\mathcal{C}$ is a binary relation on $\operatorname{ob}\mathcal{C}$ which is reflective and transitive
and $\mathcal{C}$ is called a preorder.
A [[Partial Order|partially ordered set]] is a [[Small Category|small]] preorder whose only isomorphisms are identities

### Lemma
Every [[Morphism]] is a [[Monomorphism]] and [[Epimorphism]].
In particular, a preorder is balanced
if and only if
it is a [[Groupoid]].
