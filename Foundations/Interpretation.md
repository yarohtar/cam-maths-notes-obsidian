Let $L=L(\Omega,\Pi)$ be a [[First-order predicate Logic]] language.
Let $A$ be an $L$-[[Structure]].
Let $t$ be a term in $L$ and $p$ a formula in $L$,
both having [[Free Variable]] in $\{ x_{1},\dots,x_{n} \}$
We define interpretations:
$$
t_{A}:A^{n}\to A
$$
$$
p_{A}:A^{n}\to \{ 0,1 \}
$$
by induction on the language $L$.

Full definition is in Zsaks notes on page 33.
It is just the obvious thing.
