A [[Communication Channel]] can transmit reliably at rate $R$ if 
there is a sequence of [[Binary Code]]s $C_{1},C_{2},\dots$ 
where $C_{n}$ is a code of length $n$ and size $\lfloor 2^{nR} \rfloor$ 
(i.e. they have [[Information Rate]] $\lim_{n\to \infty}\rho(C_{n})=R$)
such that [[Maximum Error Probability]]
$$
\hat{e}(C_{n})\to 0 \quad %quad
\text{as}\quad %quad
 n\to \infty
$$
