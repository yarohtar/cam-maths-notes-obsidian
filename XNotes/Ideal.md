For a ring $R$, and $I\subseteq R$ we write $I\triangleleft R$ if $I$ is a subgroup for addition and for any $r\in R$ we have $rI\subseteq I$. Then $R/I$ is a ring (where the quotient is taken as if they were just additive groups). 

If $\phi:R\to S$ is a ring homomorphism, then $\ker \phi\triangleleft R$.

For $a_1\dots a_n\in R$, the ideal generated by them is:
$$I=(a_1\dots a_n)=\{r_1a_1+\dots r_na_n\mid r_1,\dots r_n\in R\}$$
If $I=(a)$ for some $a\in R$ then $I$ is principal.

### Lemma
A ring $R$ is a field iff its only ideals are $R$ and $\{0\}$.
