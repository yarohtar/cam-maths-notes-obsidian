A first integral of [[Time Evolution of Dynamical Variables]] is a non-constant solution $f=f(p(t),q(t),t)$ s.t. $\frac{df}{dt}=0$ 


Each first integral reduces the order of this equation.
In particular, if $f$ is a first integral with $dimM=2n$, then the trajectory will be confined to a hypersurface $f(p,q)=const$
If we find $L$ independent first integrals, the trajectory will be in their intersection, which in general has dimension $2n-L$.
If $L=2n-1$, then the trajectory is completely determined (it is just a curve).

Unfortunately, in general the surfaces are degenerate and do not separate the points so we can't rly do this. Sufficiently complicated systems behave in a more probabilistic manner (think thermodynamics), but it is a millennium problem to see if this follows from our equations (ergodic hypothesis)

In this course we only consider sufficiently nice equations.
