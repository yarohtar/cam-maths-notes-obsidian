$X$ is compact if every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover.

[[Compact-closed]]
### Theorem
If $X\neq\emptyset$ is compact and $f:X\to\mathbb R$ is [[Continuous]] 
then $f$ is [[Bounded]] and attains its bound.
#### Proof sketch
Consider $\{f^{-1}((f(x)-1,f(x)+1)):x\in X\}$, a cover of $X$. 
It has a finite subcover, 
and $f$ is bounded in each set of the subcover, 
so $f$ is bounded on the union of those finitely many sets.
Now let $m=\inf_{x\in X}f(x)$ and suppose for every $x\in X$ we have $f(x)>m$. 
Hence find $m_x$ s.t. $f(x)>m_x>m$. 
Now $x\in f^{-1}((m_x,\infty))$, 
so these sets build a cover of $X$.
Hence find a finite subcover and smallest $m_x$ from that subcover. 
But then $X=f^{-1}((m_{x},\infty))$ so:
$$
m=\inf_{x\in X}f(x)\geq m_x>m
$$
