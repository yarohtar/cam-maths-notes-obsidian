We say [[Topological Space]] $X$ is separable if it has a countable dense subset.
#### Example
Given [[L norms]]:
Each $l_{p}$ is separable for $1\leq p< \infty$ (take finite rational sequences). 
But $l_{\infty}$ is not separable, e.g. consider $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and indicators $1_{A}\in l_{\infty}$.
There is uncountably many indicators, and we cannot capture all of them.
