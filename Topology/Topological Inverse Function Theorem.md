If $f:X\to Y$ is a continuous bijection,
$X$ is compact and $Y$ is [[Hausdorff]],
then $f$ is a homeomorphism.
#### Proof
Enough to check $f$ is an open map which is equiv to $f$ being a closed map for bijections.
Fix any closed $V\subseteq X$. Then $V$ is compact since $X$ is compact.
Then the image $f(V)$ is compact,
but then $f(V)$ is closed (by [[Compact-closed]]),
hence we are done.
