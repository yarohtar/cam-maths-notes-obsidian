A subset $K\subseteq \mathbb R^n$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
#### Proof
Suppose $K$ is compact. Then $f:K\to\mathbb R$ by $f(x)=||x||$ is [[Compactness#Theorem|bounded]], so $K$ is bounded. Furthermore, $K$ is [[Compact-closed|closed]] in [[Hausdorff]] $\mathbb R^n$. 
Conversely, if $K$ is closed and bounded, find interval $[-M,M]$ s.t. $K\subseteq [-M,M]^n$. Then this space is a [[Tychonorff's Theorem on Finite Products|finite product]] of [[Closed interval is compact|compact intervals]] hence compact. But then $K$ is also [[Compact-closed|compact]], as a closed subspace.
