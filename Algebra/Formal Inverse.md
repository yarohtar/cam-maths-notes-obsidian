Let $A(x)$ be a [[Formal Power Series]] in a [[Algebra/Ring Theory/Ring|Ring]] $R$ 
such that $A(0)=a_{0}\in R$ has a multiplicative inverse.
Then we define 
$$
\frac{1}{A(x)} = b_{0} + b_{1}x + b_{2}x^{2} + \dots
$$
given by $b_{0}=a_{0}^{-1}$ and 
$$
b_{n} = a_{0}^{-1} \left( - \sum_{r=1}^{n} b_{n-r} a_{r} \right)
$$
### Lemma
The formal inverse of $1-x$ is 
$$
\frac{1}{1-x} = 1+ x + x^{2} + \dots
$$
