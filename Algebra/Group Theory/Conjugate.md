Let $G$ be a [[Group]]
Let $a,b\in G$
We say $a$ and $b$ are conjugate if for some $g\in G$ we have:
$$
a=gbg^{-1}
$$
This is an equivalence relation.
Its equivalence classes are called [[Conjugacy Class|conjugacy classes]]

Similarly, let $A,B\subseteq G$
Then $A$ and $B$ are conjugate if for some $g\in G$
$$
A=gBg^{-1}=\{ gbg^{-1}:b\in B \}
$$
