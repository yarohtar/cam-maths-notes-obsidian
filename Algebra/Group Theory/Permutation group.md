The group $S_{n}$ of all permutations of the set $\{ 1,2,\dots ,n \}$.
### Unique factorisation
Each $\sigma\in S_n$ has a factorisation in $\sigma=\sigma_1\sigma_2\dots \sigma_k$ where $\sigma_i$ are disjoint cycles. 
This factorisation is unique up to permutations of $\sigma_i$.
[[Cycle Type]]
### Unique sign
Each $\sigma\in S_n$ can be written as a product of transpositions 
(for example, by decomposing each cycle into a product of transpositions).
Then there is a [[Homomorphism]] $\operatorname{sgn}:S_n\to \{\pm 1\}$  
where $\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)=1$ if $\sigma$ can be written with an even number of transpositions, 
while $\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)=-1$ if it can't. 
### Proposition
This is well defined.

It induces an [[Alternating group]] $A_{n}\leq S_{n}$.
