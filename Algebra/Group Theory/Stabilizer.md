Suppose we have a [[Group Action]] of a [[Group]] $G$ on a set $X$.
The stabilizer of $x\in X$ is defined as:
$$
G_{x} = \{ g\in G : g.x=x\}
$$
### Proposition
The stabilizer is a [[Subgroup]] of $G$.
NOTE: Not necessarily [[Normal]]. 

### Proposition
Suppose $x,y\in X$ are in the same [[Orbit]]
Then the stabilizers $G_{x}$ and $G_{y}$ are [[Conjugate]] (in the sense of subsets)
#### Proof
Let $y=g.x$.
Then check $G_{y}=gG_{x}g^{-1}$
