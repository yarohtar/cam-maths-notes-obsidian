Conjugacy class is an [[Orbit]] 
of the [[Conjugation]] [[Group Action]]
of a [[Group]] $G$ on itself.

It is an equivalence class of [[Conjugate]] relation.

For a [[Group]] $G$ and $a\in G$ we write 
$$
\operatorname{Ccl}_{G}(a)=\{ gag^{-1}:g\in G \}
$$

### Proposition
A [[Subgroup]] $H\leq G$ is [[Normal]] 
if and only if 
it is a disjoint union of conjugacy classes.
NOTE: A disjoint union of conjugacy classes need not be a subgroup.
