Suppose $S_{n}$ is a [[Permutation group]] and $\sigma \in S_{n}$
Let $\sigma=\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\dots \sigma_{k}$ be the unique cycle factorisation of $\sigma$
with lengths $l_{1},l_{2},\dots,l_{k}$ respectively.
WLOG $l_{i}$ are decreasing.
The cycle type of $\sigma$ is $(l_{1},l_{2},\dots,l_{k})$
