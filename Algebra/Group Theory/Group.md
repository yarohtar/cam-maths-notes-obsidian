A group is an ordered pair $(G,\cdot)$ 
where $\cdot:G\times G\to G$ respecting the following axioms:
1. [[Associativity]]: for any $a,b,c\in G$ we have $a(bc)=(ab)c$
2. There is some element $e\in G$ with $ge=eg=g$ for all $g\in G$
3. Every element $g\in G$ has an inverse $g^{-1}\in G$ such that:
$$
gg^{-1}=g^{-1}g=e
$$
### Category Theory Definition
A group is a [[Monoid]] in which all morphisms are isomorphisms.
