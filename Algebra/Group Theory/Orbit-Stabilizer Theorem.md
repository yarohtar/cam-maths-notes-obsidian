Let $G$ be a [[Group]] and $X$ a set.
Suppose we have a [[Group Action]] $G\times X\to X$. 
Let $x\in X$
Then there is a bijection between the [[Orbit]] of $x$ 
and the [[Coset|cosets]] of [[Stabilizer]] of $x$ i.e.:
$$
Orb_{G}(x) \to G /G_{x}
$$
Furthermore, if $G$ is finite, then
$$|Orb_G(x)|\cdot |G_x|=|G|$$
#### Proof
Send $g(x)\to gG_x$.
