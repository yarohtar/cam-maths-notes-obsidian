For a [[Algebra/Ring Theory/Ring|Ring]] $R$, and $I\subseteq R$ 
We say $I$ is an ideal if $I$ is a [[Subgroup]] for addition 
and for any $r\in R$ we have $rI\subseteq I$. 
We write $I\triangleleft R$.
[[Quotient Ring]]

If $\phi:R\to S$ is a [[Ring Homomorphism]], then $\ker \phi\triangleleft R$.

For $a_1\dots a_n\in R$, the ideal generated by them is:
$$I=(a_1\dots a_n)=\{r_1a_1+\dots r_na_n\mid r_1,\dots r_n\in R\}$$
[[Principal Ideal]]
### Lemma
A ring $R$ is a field
if and only if
its only ideals are $R$ and $\{0\}$.
