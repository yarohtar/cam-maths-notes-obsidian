We assume that $R$ is a [[Unique Factorisation Domain]],
in particular $R$ is an [[Integral Domain]] and hence has a [[Field of Fractions]] $F$. 
Also $F[X]$ is a [[Unique Factorisation Domain]] since it is an [[Euclidean Domain]] 
(with Euclidean function $\deg$).

The content of a polynomial $f(X)=a_0+a_1X+\dots +a_nX^n$ for $a_i\in R$ is $c(f)=\gcd (a_0\dots a_n)$. 
We say $f$ is primitive if $c(f)$ is a unit, i.e. the coefficients are coprime.
