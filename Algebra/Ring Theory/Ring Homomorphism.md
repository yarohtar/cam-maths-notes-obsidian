Let $(R,+,\cdot)$ and $(S,+,\cdot)$ be [[Algebra/Ring Theory/Ring|Rings]] and let $\phi:R\to S$
We say that $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism if:
- $\phi$ is a [[Homomorphism]] for groups $(R,+)$ and $(S,+)$
- $\phi(rt)=\phi(r)\phi(t)$ for any $r,t\in R$
- $\phi(1)=1$ i.e. preserves multiplicative identity
