An  [[Integral domain]] $R$ is a UFD if:
- Every nonzero and nonunit $r\in R$ is a product of irreducibles
- If $p_1\dots p_m=q_1\dots q_n$ where $p_i,q_i$ are irreducibles, then $m=n$ and $\exists \sigma\in S_n$ s.t. $p_i$ is an associate of $q_{\sigma(i)}$.

### Proposition 
Let $R$ be an integral domain where every element is a product of irreducibles. Then $R$ is UFD iff every irreducible is prime. 

### Theorem
If $R$ is a UFD, so is $R[X]$.
