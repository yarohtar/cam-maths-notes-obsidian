Let $R$ be a [[Unique Factorisation Domain]] with a [[Field of Fractions]] $F$. 
Suppose $f\in R[X]$ is primitive and irreducible in $R[X]$. 
Then $f$ is irreducible in $F[X]$.
### Lemma
1. A prime element in $R$ is also prime in $R[X]$.
2. If $f,g\in R[X]$ are primitive then $fg$ is also primitive
3. If $f,g\in R[X]$, then $c(fg)=c(f)c(g)$ up to associates

### Lemma
Let $f,g\in R[X]$ and $g$ is primitive. 
If $g\mid f$ in $F[X]$, then $g\mid f$ in $R[X]$, where $F$ is the [[Field of Fractions]] of $R$.
