Given the [[Unlabelled Structure]] from $\mathcal{A}:\mathcal{B}\to \mathcal{B}_{R}$
its ordinary generating function as a [[Formal Power Series]] in $R[[x]]$ is:
$$
f_{\mathcal{A}}(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \mathcal{A}[n]
$$
its ordinary generating function is a [[Formal Power Series]] in $R[[x]]$
$$
f_{\mathcal{A}}(x) = \sum_{\alpha \in A} v(\alpha)
$$
Note that this is well defined 
as there is only finitely many $\alpha \in A$ such that $\deg v(\alpha)= n$ for each $n$.
