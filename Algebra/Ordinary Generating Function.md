Given a [[Combinatorial Structure|Structure]] $\mathcal{A}=(A,v)$, with $v:A\to R[x]$ 
its ordinary generating function is a [[Formal Power Series]] in $R[[x]]$
$$
f_{\mathcal{A}}(x) = \sum_{\alpha \in A} v(\alpha)
$$
Note that this is well defined 
as there is only finitely many $\alpha \in A$ such that $\deg v(\alpha)= n$ for each $n$.
