Let $V$ be a vector space over field $F$
The dual $V^{*}$ is $L(V,F)$, the space of all [[Linear]] functions from $V$ to $F$
### Proposition
This is well defined

### Proposition
There is a natural isomorphism between $V$ and $V^{* *}$.
#### Proof
Let $v\in V$
Let $\theta \in L(V,F)=V^{*}$
Consider the map $\theta_{v}$
