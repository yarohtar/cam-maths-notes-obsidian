We say that $(F,+,\cdot)$ is a field if:
- $(F,+)$ is an [[Abelian]] [[Group]] with identity $0$
- $(F \setminus \{ 0 \},\cdot)$ is an [[Abelian]] [[Group]]
- Distributivity holds:
$$
a(b+c)=ab + ac
$$
### Theorem
Every finite [[Subgroup]] of the multiplicative [[Group]] of a [[Field]] is cyclic.
#### Proof
Suppose $A$ is a finite multiplicative subgroup of a field. 
Then $A$ is [[Abelian]]. 
Hence, $A$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $C_m\times C_m$ for some $m\geq 2$.  
But then $f(X)=X^m-1$ has at least $m^2$ roots.
