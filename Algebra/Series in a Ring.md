Let $R$ be a [[Algebra/Ring Theory/Ring|Ring]] and let 
$$
a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\dots
$$
be a sequence in $R$ that is eventually $0$, 
i.e. $a_{n}=0$ for all $n\geq N$ for some fixed $N\in \mathbb{N}$
Then we define
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} = \sum_{n=0}^{N} a_{n}
$$
Note that this is well defined for any such $N$.
