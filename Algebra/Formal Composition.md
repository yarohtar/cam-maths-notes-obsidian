Given $A(x)=\sum_{n\geq 0}a_{n}x^{n}$ with $a_{0}=0$ 
and $B(x)=\sum_{n\geq 0}b_{n}x^{n}$ [[Formal Power Series]]
define the composition 
$$
B(A(x)) = \sum_{k\geq 0} b_{k} A(x)^{k}
$$
as a [[Series of Formal Power Series]].
Note that $a_{0}=0$ was necessary but also sufficient for convergence.
### Definition
For $B(x)=1+x+x^{2}+\dots$ define:
$$
\frac{1}{1-A(x)}=B(A(x))
$$
