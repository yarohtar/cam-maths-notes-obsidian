Given [[Formal Power Series]] in a [[Algebra/Ring Theory/Ring|Ring]] $R$:
$$
A(x)=\sum_{n\geq 0}a_{n}x^{n}
$$
$$
B(x)=\sum_{n\geq 0}b_{n}x^{n}
$$
with $a_{0}=0$, define the composition 
$$
B(A(x)) = \sum_{k\geq 0} b_{k} A(x)^{k}
$$
as a [[Series of Formal Power Series]].
Note that $a_{0}=0$ was necessary but also sufficient for convergence.
### Definition
For $B(x)=1+x+x^{2}+\dots$ define:
$$
\frac{1}{1-A(x)}=B(A(x))
$$
