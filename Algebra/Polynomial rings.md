We assume that $R$ is a [[Unique Factorisation Domain]], in particular $R$ is an [[Integral domain]] and hence has a field of fractions $F$. Also $F[X]$ is a UFD since it is an [[Euclidean Domain]] (with Euclidean function $\deg$).

The content of a polynomial $f(X)=a_0+a_1X+\dots +a_nX^n$ for $a_i\in R$ is $c(f)=\gcd (a_0\dots a_n)$. We say $f$ is primitive if $c(f)$ is a unit, i.e. the coefficients are coprime.
