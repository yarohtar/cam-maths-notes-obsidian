### First isomorphism theorem
Let $\phi :R\to S$ be a ring homomorphism. Then $\ker\phi$ is an [[Ideal|ideal]] of $R$ and we have $$R/\ker \phi\cong \mathrm{Im} \phi\leq S$$
#### Proof
Same as in [[The isomorphism theorems]], just add in some ring stuff to check.
### Second isomorphism theorem
Let $R\leq S$ and $J\triangleleft S$. Then $R\cap J\triangleleft R$ and $R+J\leq S$ and
$$R/(R\cap J)\cong (R+J)/J\leq S/J$$
### Third isomorphism theorem
Let $I,J\triangleleft R$ such that $I\subseteq J$. Then $J/I\triangleleft R/I$ and:
$$(R/I)/(J/I)\cong R/J$$
