### Definition
Having a path between two points is an equivalence relation and the equivalence classes are called the path components of $X$.
The set of path components is $\pi_{0}(X)$. If $\pi_{0}(X)=\{ * \}$ then $X$ is path connected.

## Path component map
### Proposition
Given a map $f:X\to Y$, get a well define function:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_{0}(f):\pi_{0}(X)&\to\pi_{0}(Y) \\
[x]&\to[f(x)]
\end{align}
$$
and it satisfies:
1. $f\simeq g\implies \pi_{0}(f)=\pi_{0}(g)$
2. If $h:X\to Y$ and $k:Y\to Z$ are maps then $\pi_{0}(kh)=\pi_{0}(k)\pi_{0}(h)$
3. $\pi_{0}()$
