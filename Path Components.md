### Definition
Having a path between two points is an equivalence relation and the equivalence classes are called the path components of $X$.
The set of path components is $\pi_{0}(X)$. If $\pi_{0}(X)=\{ * \}$ then $X$ is path connected.

## Path component map
### Proposition
Given a map $f:X\to Y$, get a well define function:
