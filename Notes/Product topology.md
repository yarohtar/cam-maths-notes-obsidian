Let $(X,\tau)$ and $(Y,\rho)$ be topological spaces.
Then equip $X\times Y$ with the product topology generated by the base
$$\{U\times V: U\in \tau, V\in \rho\}$$
i.e. all open sets in the product topology are $\bigcup_{i,j} U_i\times V_j$ where $U_i\in\tau$ and $V_j\in\rho$. 
THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A COUNTABLE UNION!!!!
