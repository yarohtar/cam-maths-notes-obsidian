Let $S$ be a [[Theory]] in a countable language (i.e. $\Omega \cup \Pi$ is countable)
If $S$ has a [[Model (First-order Logic)]], then $S$ has a countable model.
#### Proof
By the [[Soundness Theorem (First-order Logic)]], $S$ is consistent.
Then the model constructed in the proof of [[Model Existence Lemma (First-order Logic)]] is countable.
