Every continuous map $f:D^2\to D^2$ has a fixed point.
#### Proof
By contradiction.
Suppose $f:D^2\to D^2$ is continuous with no fixed points.
Define $r:D^2\to S^1$ 
with $x\to$ half line through $x$ starting at $f(x)$ intersect $S^1$
This is well defined as $f(x)\neq x$ for all $x$.
If $f$ is cts then so is $r$.
Also by construction $r(S^1)=id_{S^1}$
Upshot: $r$ is a [[Retraction map|retraction]] which is a contradiction by [[Fundamental group of the circle]].
