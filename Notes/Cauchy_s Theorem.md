## Real Sequences
### Theorem
A real sequence $x_n$ is convergent if and only if:
$$\forall\epsilon\ \exists M\in N\ \forall n,m>M\ |x_n-x_m|<\epsilon$$
### Proof
One way is trivial.
Prove that it is bounded and then use [[Boltzano-Weierstrass theorem#Real sequences]]

## $R^n$ sequences
### Theorem
Same statement as for Real sequences.
#### Proof
One way is again trivial.
Note that Cauchy's condition holds for each coordinate, so apply the Real Cauchy's Theorem to each of them and obtain the result.
