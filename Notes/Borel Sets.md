Let $E$ be a [[Hausdorff space]]. The $\sigma$-algebra generated by the set of open sets in $E$ is called the Borel [[sigma-algebra]] of $E$ and is denoted $\mathcal{B}(E)$. 

A [[Measure]] $\mu$ on $(E,\mathcal{B}(E))$ is called a Borel measure on $E$. 

If moreover $\mu(K)<\infty$ for all [[Compactness|compact]] sets $K$, then $\mu$ is called a Rradon measure on $E$.

Also the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of $\mathbb{R}$ is denoted simply by $\mathcal{}$
