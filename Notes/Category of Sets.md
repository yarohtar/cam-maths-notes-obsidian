The category of all sets and functions between them denoted by $\mathrm{Set}$
Formally, morphisms are pairs $(f,B)$ where $f\subseteq A\times B$ is a [[Function]]
(this is because codomain of $f$ is not uniquely defined in set theory)

See also [[Category of Relations]] and [[Category of Partial Functions]]
and note:
$$
\mathrm{Set} \subseteq \mathrm{Part} \subseteq \mathrm{Rel}
$$
