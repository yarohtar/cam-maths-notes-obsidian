### Type 0
[[Formal Language]] $\mathcal{L}(G)$ for any [[Grammar]] $G$.
### Type 1
[[Formal Language]] $\mathcal{L}(G)$ for [[Rewrite Rule#Noncontracting|noncontracting]] [[Grammar]] $G$.
[[Noncontracting Formal Language]]
### Type 2
[[Formal Language]] $\mathcal{L}(G)$ for [[Rewrite Rule#Context-free|context free]] [[Grammar]] $G$.
[[Context-Free Formal Language]]
### Type 3
[[Formal Language]] $\mathcal{L}(G)$ for [[Rewrite Rule#Regular|regular]] [[Grammar]] $G$.
[[Regular Formal Language]]

### Example
$L=\{ 0^{n}1^{n}:n>0 \}$ is context-free, not regular.
#### Proof
It is context-free with rewrite rules $S\to 0S 1$ and $S\to 01$ which produce $L$.
It is not regular.
Suppose it is. Then it satisfies [[Regular Pumping Lemma]]. 
But clearly it doesn't.
