Given a set of symbols $\Sigma$, the set of all strings is $\mathbb{W}=\Sigma ^{*}$, also called the set of words.

A formal language is any subset $L\subseteq \mathbb{W}$.

### Definition
If $G$ is a [[Grammar]] and $\mathcal{D}(G,S)$ is the set of all [[Derivable Strings]] from $G$, then $\mathcal{L}(G)=\mathcal{D}(G,S)\cap \mathbb{W}$ is a [[Formal Language]] derived by $G$.
