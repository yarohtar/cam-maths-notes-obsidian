Let $C(M,N)$ be the space of bounded continuous functions from metric space $M$ to metric space $N$ with uniform metric.
Suppose $N$ is complete. Then $C(M,N)$ is complete.

### Proof sketch
Let $l_\infty (M, N)$ be the space of bounded functions $M\to N$ with uniform metric. This is complete. Now $C(M,N)$ is a subspace of $l_\infty(M,N)$. It is also closed because of uniform convergence stuff. Hence, as a closed subspace of a complete space, it is complete.
