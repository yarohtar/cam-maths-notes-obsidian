We send a [[Binary Code]] through a [[Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC)]] making $n$ uses of the channel. Probability $p$ is the probability of a bit being mismatched.

The [[Information Rate]] of $C$ is $\rho(C)=\frac{\log m}{n}$

The error rate depends on the decoding rule. We consider 3 possible rules:
1. [[Ideal Observer Decoding Rule]]
2. [[Maximum Likelihood Decoding Rule]]
3. [[Minimum Distance Decoding Rule]] (we use this one)
#### Remark
Some convention needed in the case of a tie, eg. choose at random or ask for message to be sent again.
