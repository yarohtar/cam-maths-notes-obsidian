Let $X$ be a [[Banach Space]] and $T\in L(X)$
$T$ is invertible if there is some $S\in L(X)$ such that $ST=TS=I$
[[Space of invertible linear maps]]


$T\in L(X)$ invertible $\iff$
$T$ is a bijection and $T^{-1}$ is continuous $\iff$
$T$ is a bijection [[Inversion Theorem]] $\iff$
$T$ is injective and surjective 

Note that we need both in general, unlike the final dimensional spaces.


### Theorem
Let $X$ be a [[Banach Space]] and $T\in L(X)$. 
Then $\lVert T \rVert<1$ implies $I-T$ is invertible
with $(I-T)^{-1}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}T^{n}$
