Every day at noon you make a bet.
You give your friend $k$ pounds and they flip a coin
1. if it lands on heads, you receive $ku$ pounds
2. if it lands on tails, you receive $0$ pounds
The coin lands on heads with probability $p$
What proportion of your wealth should you bet each day in order to remain in the game long term?

Let $w$ be the proportion of bet you are gambling
Let $Z_{n}$ be your wealth after $n$ days.
Then
$Z_{n+1}=Z_{n}Y_{n+1}$
where
$Y_{n+1}=uw+(1-w)$ if $(n+1)th$ toss is a head or 
$Y_{n+1}=1-w$  if it is a tail
