### Lemma
A finite field has order of a prime power.
Moreover, this is unique.
#### Proof
A finite field has prime [[Characteristic of a ring]] 
(otherwise, it wouldn't be an [[Integral domain]])

So say that our field has characteristic $p$ where $p$ is prime.
Then consider the field as the vector space of dimension $n$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$
This has size $p^{n}$.

### Theorem
Any finite field can be represented as a quotient 
$$
K=\mathbb{F}_{p}[X] / (f)
$$
where $f$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ and $p$ is prime.
The field will have order $p^{n}$.

### Lemma
If $q=p^{\alpha}$ for $\alpha\geq 1$, the unique field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$
