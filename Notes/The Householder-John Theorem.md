Let $A$ and $B$ are real matrices such that 
both $A$ and $A-B-B^T$ are symmetric positive definite.
Define $H=-(A-B)^{-1}B$.
Then $\rho(H) < 1$
#### Proof
Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $H$ 
and $w$ a (possibly complex) eigenvector.
Write:
$$
-Bw = \lambda(A-B) w
$$
$$
Bw = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda-1} Aw
$$
Note that for a symmetric positive definite matrix $C$:
$$
(u+iv)C(u-iv) = 
$$
