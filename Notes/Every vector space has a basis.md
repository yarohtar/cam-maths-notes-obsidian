Every vector space has a basis.
#### Proof
We seek a maximal (wrt inclusion) linearly independent subset $B$ of $V$. Then $B$ is a basis.

Let $X=\{ A\subseteq V :A\text{ is L.I.} \}$ partially ordered by inclusion.
Let $C=\{ A_{i}:i\in I \}$ be a chain in $X$. We show that $A=\bigcup_{i\in I}A_{i}$
is an upper bound for $C$.
We have $A_{i}\subseteq A$ for all $i\in I$.
We need $A\in X$ i.e. $A$ is linearly independent.
Assume $\sum_{j=1}^{n}\lambda_{j}x_{j}=0$ is a linearly
