We define two concepts:
[[Operational Channel Capacity]]
[[Information Channel Capacity]]

We prove they are the same in 
[[Shannon's noisy coding theorem (2nd coding theorem)]]

Let $\lvert \Sigma \rvert=q$. A code of length $n$ is a subset of $\Sigma^{n}$ (usually we take $q=2$)
A code is used to send messages through a [[Discrete Memoryless Channel (DMC)]] with $q$ input letters. For each code, a [[Decoding rule]] is chosen

[[Maximum Error Probability]]
[[Operational Channel Capacity]]
[[Information Channel Capacity]]
