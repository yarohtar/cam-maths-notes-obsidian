Let $F$ be a field and $g\in F[X]$. 
Then the splitting field of $g$ is the smallest field extension of $F$
such that $g$ factorizes into linear factors. 
### Method
In general, to find the splitting field we do the following:
Factor $g$ into irreducible factors $g=g_{1},g_{2},\dots,g_{k}$ in $F[X]$.
Choose any nonlinear factor $f$. 
Construct the field extension $F[X] /(f)$.
In this new field, $X$ will be a root of $f$
