A DMC is a [[Communication Channel]] for which 
$$
P_{ij}=P(b_{j}\text{ received}\mid a_{i}\text{ sent})
$$
is the same each time the channel is used, it is independent of all past uses

[[Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC)]]
[[Binary Erasure Channel]]

### Lemma
The $n$-th [[Communication Channel Extension]] of a DMC with [[Information Channel Capacity]] $C$ has information capacity $nC$
#### Proof
We take rv input $X_{1}\dots X_{n}=X$ and rv output $Y_{1}\dots Y_{n}=Y$
Now 
$$
H(Y|X)=\sum_{x\in X}
$$
