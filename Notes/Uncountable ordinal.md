There exist uncountable ordinals.
##### Idea
If there's an uncountable ordinal then there's a least $\alpha$
Then $I_{\alpha}$ is the set of all countable ordinals, ie, [[Order Type]] of [[Well-ordered]] of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$

#### Proof
$$
A=\{ (M,R)\in P\mathbb{N}\times P(\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}): R \text{ is well ordering of } \}
$$
