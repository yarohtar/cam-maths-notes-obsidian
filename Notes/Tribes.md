### Definition
A tribe (or $\sigma-$algebra) on $E$ is a family $\mathcal A\subset \mathcal{P}(E)$ such that
1. $E \in \mathcal A$
2. $A\in \mathcal A \implies A^c \in \mathcal A$
3. If $(A_n)_{n\in \mathbb N}$ is a family of sets in $\mathcal A$ then $\cup_{n\in \mathbb N}A_{n}\in \mathcal A$
###### Remark
If you allow only finite unions in 3. then $\mathcal A$ is called an algebra
$\sigma-$algebra are countable unions
