For any set $X$, there's an ordinal $\gamma$ that doesn't inject into $X$.
#### Proof
This is a generalization of [[Uncountable ordinal]].
We form the set $B$ consisting of [[Order Type]]$s$ of [[Well-ordered]] of subsets of $X$. Let $\gamma=(supB)^{+}$
If $\gamma$ injects into $X$, then $\gamma$ induces a well-ordering on a subset of $X$ of order-type $\gamma$. Thus $\gamma \in B$, so $\gamma=supB^{+}\leq supB=\gamma$ which is a contradiction

### Notation
The least ordinal that doesn't inject into $X$ is denoted $\gamma(X)$.
