NONEXAMINABLE (part ii)
For any normed space $X$ there is a completion of $X$ meaning a complete norrmed space in which $X$ is dense

Let $\tilde{X}$ be the set of all Cauchy sequences in $X$, Quotiented by equiv relation $(x_{n})\sim(y_{n})$ if $x_{n}-y_{n}\to 0$.
This is naturally a vector space 
AND a normed space $\lVert [(x_{n})] \rVert=\lim_{ n \to \infty }\lVert x_{n} \rVert$
Then $\tilde{X}$ complete (diagonal subsequence), and $X$ is dense in $\tilde{X}$ via $x\to[(x,x \dots)]$
