A communication channel takes letters from an input alphabet $\Sigma_{1}=\{ a_{1},\dots ,a_{k} \}$ and emits letters from an output alphabet $\Sigma_{2}=\{ b_{1}\dots b_{k} \}$.
A channel is determined by the probabilities 
$$
P(y_{1}\dots y_{k} \text{ received} \mid x_{1}\dots x_{k} \text{ sent})
$$

After receiving a word through a communication channel, we hope to recover the original message. 
We use a [[Decoding rule]] and analyze some properties of the channel:
[[Maximum Error Probability]]
[[Transmit Reliably]]
[[Channel Capacity]]
