A probability space  $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ (ie a [[Measure|measure space]] with $\mathbb{P}(\Omega)=1$) provides a model for an experiment whose outcome is subjective to chance, according to the following interpretation:
- $\Omega$ is the set of possible outcomes
- $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of observable sets of outcomes or events
- $\mathbb{P}(A)$ is the probability of the event $A$.

In addition to [[Measure|measure theory]], probability theory also has the notion of [[Independence]].
