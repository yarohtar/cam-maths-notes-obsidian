A structure in a first-order language $L=L(\Omega,\Pi)$ (or $L$-structure) is a non-empty set $A$ together with functions $\omega_{A}:A^{n}\to A$
(where $\omega \in \Omega$ and $n=\alpha(\omega)$)
and subset $\phi_{A}\subseteq A^{n}$ (where $\phi \in\Pi$ and $n=\alpha(\phi)$)
(or identifying a subset with its indicator function
$\phi_{A}:A^{n}\to \{ 0,1 \}$)

#### Note 
If $\alpha(\omega)=0$ then $\omega$ is called a constant. Its interpretation in a structure is $\omega_{A}:A^{0}\to A$ i.e. an element $\omega_{A}\in A$
