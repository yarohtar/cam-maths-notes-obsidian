A [[Grammar|grammar]] $G=(\Sigma,V,S,P)$ is variable-based if $P$ only contains rules whose LHS is a string of variables in $V$ (ie we cannot rewrite a terminal symbol).
### Lemma
Every grammar is equivalent to a variable-based grammar
#### Proof
Idea: For each terminal symbol $a\in \Sigma$, define a variable $X_{a}$ and add appropriate rules $P'=\{ X(\alpha)\to X(\beta):\alpha \to \beta \in P \}$ and also add recovery rules $\{ X_{a}\to a : a\in \Sigma\}$.
Then prove that the languages are the same
