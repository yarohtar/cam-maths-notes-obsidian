An $[n,m]$ binary code is a subset $C\subseteq \{ 0,1 \}^{n}$ of size $m$. We say $C$ has length $n$. The elements of $C$ are called codewords. 
(so it's a block code)

We send a [[Binary Code]] through a [[Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC)]] making $n$ uses of the channel. Probability $p$ is the probability of a bit being mismatched.

The [[Information Rate]] of $C$ is $\rho(C)=\frac{\log m}{n}$
