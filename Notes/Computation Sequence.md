Given a [[Register Machines|register machine]] $M$ with upper register index $n$ and a [[Configuration of a Register Machine]] $C$ of length $n+1$, we can define the action of $M$ on $C$. We say that $M$ transforms $C$ to $C'$.
The definition is as expected based on the $Q$-instructions.

### Definition
If $M$ is a register machine with upper register index $n$ and $\vec{w}=(w_{0},w_{1},\dots w_{n})\in \mathbb{B}^{n+1}$
