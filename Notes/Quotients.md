For $X$ [[Normed Spaces]], $N$ a closed subspace of $X$, have Quotient vector space $X / N$ with projection map $R$.
Want to put a norm on $X /N$
### Proposition
$X$ normed, $N$ a closed subspace of $X$. 
Then $\lVert ? \rVert=\inf \{ \lVert x \rVert : x \in X, Rx=? \}$ definese a norm on $X /N$. Moreover, $R$ is continuous
$X$ is Banach
