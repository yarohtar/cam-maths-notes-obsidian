## Proposition
Let $G$ be planar. Then $\delta(G)\leq 5$.
### Proof
The average degree of $G$ is $\frac{2e}{n}$
Since $e\leq 3n-6$ the average degree is at most $6-\frac{12}{n}<6$
So minimal degree is at most $5$
## Proposition
Let $G$ be planar. Then $G$ admits a $6$ colouring.
### Proof
Proof by induction. 
Let $x$ be the vertex of minimum degree in $G$
Then $G-x$ is still planar so has a $6$ colouring.
Also $x$ is connected to at most $5$ vertices in $G$ 
so we can choose a sixth colour for $x$
## Proposition
Let $G$ be planar. Then $G$ admits a $5$ colouring.
### Proof
By induction.
Let $x\in V(G)$ have degree at most $5$
Then colour $G-x$ in $5$ colours.
Let $x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4},x_{5}$ be neighbourhoods of $x$ arranged by argument
