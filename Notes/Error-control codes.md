[[Information Rate]]

The information rate of $C$ is $\rho(C)=\frac{\log n}{n}$

We send a [[Binary Code]] through a [[Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC)]] making $n$ uses of the channel. Probability $p$ is the probability of a bit being mismatched.

Remark:
Soem convention needed in the case of a tie, eg. choose at random or ask for message to be sent again.
