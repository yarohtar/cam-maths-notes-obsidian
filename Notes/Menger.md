Let $G$ be a connected graph and $a\ne b$ are not connected
The minimum size of $a-b$ [[Separator]] is the maximum number 
of disjoint paths from $a$ to $b$.
Equivalently if all $a-b$ separators have size at least $k$ 
then there exist $k$ disjoint paths from $a$ to $b$.
### Proof


## Corollary
Let $G$ be connected with $\lvert G \rvert\geq 2$
Then $G$ is $k$-connected if and only if all pairs of $a\ne b$
admit $k$ disjoint paths from $a$ to $b$.
