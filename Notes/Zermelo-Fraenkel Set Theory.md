The language has no operation symbols $\Omega=\emptyset$ and one binary predicate $\in$
There will be 9 sentences of the theory (axioms)
A model of ZF we denote by $V$ 
So $V$ is a non-empty set with an interpretation of $\in$ as a subset $\in_{V}$ of $V\times V$ 
Elements of $V$ will be called 'sets'
If $(a,b)$ is in $\in_{V}$ then say '$a$ is a member of $b$' or '$a$ belongs to $b$'
$V$ will be called the 'universe of sets'
