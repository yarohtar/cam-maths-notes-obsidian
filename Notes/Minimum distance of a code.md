The minimum distance of a [[Binary Code]] $C$ is the smallest [[Hamming distance]] between distinct codewords.

An $[n,m]$ code with minimum distance $d$ is sometimes called $[n,m,d]$

### Lemma
Let $C$ be a code with minimum distance $d$ 
1. Then $C$ is $(d-1)$ [[Error detecting]], but cannot detect $d$ errors
2. $C$ is $\left\lfloor  \frac{d-1}{2}  \right\rfloor$ [[Error correcting]], but cannot correct all sets of $\left\lfloor  \frac{d-1}{2}  \right\rfloor+1$ errors
