The minimum distance of a code $C$ is the smallest [[Hamming distance]] between distinct codewords.

An $[n,m]$ code with minimum distance $d$ is sometimes called $[n,m,d]$

### Lemma
Let $C$ be a code with minimum distance $d$ 
1. Then $C$ is $(d-1)$-error detecting, but cannot detect $d$ errors.
2.
