We have seen that $p:\tilde{X}\to X$ is a path connected covering space
$x_{0}\in X$ and $\tilde{x}_{0}\in p ^{-1}(x_{0})$ the map $p_{*}:\pi_{1}(\tilde{X},\tilde{x}_{0})\to \pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is injective

So $p_{*}\pi_{1}(\tilde{X},\tilde{x}_{0})\leq \pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ a subgroup

If $\tilde{x}_{0}'\in p ^{-1}(x_{0})$ is another basepoint of $\tilde{X}$, 
as $\tilde{X}$ path-connected, can choose a path $\gamma:\tilde{x}_{0}\leadsto \tilde{x}_{0}'$.
Then $p\circ \gamma$ is a loop in $X$ based at $x_{0}$, $[p\circ \gamma]\in \pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$
and 
$[p\circ \gamma]^{-1}\cdot p_{*}\pi_{1}(\tilde{X},\tilde{x}_{0})\cdot[p\circ \gamma]=p_{*}\pi_{1}(\tilde{X},\tilde{x}_{0}')\leq \pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$
ie the two subgroups obtained are conjugate.

So fixing $(X,x_{0})$ we have functions
$$
\{ \text{based covering maps }p:(\tilde{X},\tilde{x}_{0})\to(X,x_{0}) \}\to \{ \text{subgroups of }\pi_{1}(X,x_{0}) \}
$$
and 
$$
\left\{  \text{covering map }p:\tilde{X}\to X  \right\}\to \{ \text{conjugacy classes of subgroups of } \pi_{1}(X,x_{0})\}
$$
Want to show that imposing appropriate equivalence relations of LHSs, makes those into bijections.

### Proposition
Suppose that $X$ is path-connected, [[Locally Path Connected]], and [[Semi-locally Simply Connected]].
Then any subgroup $H\leq \pi_{1}()$
