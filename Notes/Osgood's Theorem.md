Let $f_{1},f_{2},\dots \in C[0,1]$ be pointwise bounded.
Then they are uniformly bounded on some interval $(a,b)$.
#### Proof
For $n=1,2,\dots$ let $E_{n}=\{ x\in [0,1] : \forall i \lvert f_{i}(x) \rvert\leq n \}$
Then $E_{n}$ is closed for all $n$. 
Also $\bigcup E_{n}=[0,1]$ (as the $f_{i}$ are pointwise bounded)
Hence some $E_{n}$ has an interior by [[The Baire Category Theorem]].
