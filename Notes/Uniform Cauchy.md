Let $f_n:S\to\mathbb R$ be a sequence of functions. We say that $f_n$ is uniformly Cauchy on $S$ if $\forall\epsilon>0,\exists N\in\mathbb N,\forall x\in S,\forall n,m>N$
$$|f_n(x)-f_m(x)|<\epsilon$$
### General principle of uniform convergence
A sequence of uniformly Cauchy functions $f_n$ on $S$ [[Uniform convergence of functions|converges uniformly]].
#### Proof sketch
Find a pointwise limit $f$ of $f_n$ which exists by Cauchy stuff for sequences. Then fix $\epsilon>0$ and for any $x$ and big enough $n$ find $m$ big enough to make $|f(x)-f_n(x)|\leq |f(x)-f_m(x)|+|f_m(x)-f_n(x)|$ small.

### Corollary
Let $f_n$ be a sequence of functions each bounded by $M_n$. Suppose $\sum_{n=1}^\infty M_n$ converges. Then
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n$$
converges uniformly.
