##$X,Y$
### Theorem
Let $X$ be an $\infty$-dimensional normed space. Then there are some $(x_{n})\in X$ with $\lVert x_{n} \rVert=1$ for all $n$ and $\lVert x_{n}-x_{m} \rVert\geq 1$ for all $n,m$. In particular, $B_{X}$ is not complete.
# Definition
For $X$,$Y$ normed, say linear $T:X\to Y$ is compact if $\overline{T(B_{X})}$ is comopla
## Notes
- If $T:X\to Y$ compact, then certainly, $T(B_{X})$ is bounded, so $T$ is continuous.
- For $Y$ complete, $T:X\to Y$ is compact iff $T(B_{X})$ totally bounded
- $T:X\to Y$ compact iff For any $(x_{n})$ in $B_{X}$, there is a subsequence $(x_{n_{i}})$ with $(Tx_{n_{i}})$ converges in $Y$.
