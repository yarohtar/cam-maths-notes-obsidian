### Proposition
$X$, $Y$, $Z$ normed, $S\in L(X,Y)$ and $T\in L(Y,Z)$.
Then:
1. If $S$ is compact $\implies$ $T\circ S$ is compact
2. If $T$ is compact $\implies$ $T\circ S$ is compact
#### Proof
1. Given $(x_{n})$ in $B_{X}$: There is a subsequencce with $(Sx_{n_{i}})$ convergent so $(TSx_{n_{i}})$ convergent ($T$ is continuous)
2. Given $(x_{n})$ in $B_{X}$: have $(Sx_{n})$ bounded, so there is a subsequence with $(TSx_{n_{i}})$ convergent because $T$ is compact.
