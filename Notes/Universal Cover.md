A [[Covering Spaces|covering]] map $p:\tilde{X}\to X$ is a universal cover if $\tilde{X}$ is [[Simply connected]].


### Theorem
Let $X$ be path connected (1), [[Locally Path Connected]] (2), and [[Semi-locally Simply Connected]] (3). Then there exists a covering $p:\tilde{X}\to X$ with $\tilde{X}$ simply connected.

A NONEXAMINABLE PROOF
#### Proof
Fix $x_{0}\in X$.
Define aas a set:
$$
\tilde{X}=\{ \text{paths in } X \text{ starting at }x_{0} \text{ and ending anywhere up to htpy of paths} \}
$$
$p:\tilde{X}\to X$ with $[\gamma]\to \gamma(1)$
Need topology on $\tilde{X}$ st 
1. $p$ cts
2. $p$ covering map
3. $\tilde{X}$ simply connected
##### Step 0
Topology on $X$, revisited.
$\mathcal{U}=\{ U\in X: U \text{ open in } X \text{ and } U \text{ path-connected and } \pi_{1}(U,x)\to \pi_{1}\}$
