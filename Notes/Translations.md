Consider transformations of the state $R$ of a system to state $R'$ that conserve probabilities $Prob(\phi\to \psi)=Prob(\phi'\to \psi')$.
### Wigner's Theorem
In QM, these transformations are represented by a linear and unitary operator $\ket{\psi'}=U\ket{\psi}$ with $U^{\dagger}U=I$
(Or an anti linear anti unitary operator, but we'll not consider this possibility in PQM)
