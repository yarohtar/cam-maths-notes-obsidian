### The residue theorem
Let $f(z)$ be analytic in a simply connected domain $D$ except a finite number of isolated singularities $z_1\dots z_n$. Let $\gamma$ be a closed counter clockwise contour in $D$ that encloses all $z_1\dots z_n$.
Then:
$$\int_\gamma f(z)dz=2i\pi \sum_{k=1}^n \Res_{z=z_k}f(z)$$

We often make use of [[Jordan's Lemma]] when calculating an integral along a half circle when $R\to\infty$.

We do various stuff like keyhole contours and rectangular contours. Can't be bothered to put examples here. Look in notes.
