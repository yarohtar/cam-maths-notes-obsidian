Laplace integrals are of the form:
$$
I(x)=\int_{a}^b f(t)e^{x\phi(t)}dt
$$
where $f$ and $\phi$ are nice enough

Note that [[Watson's lemma]] deals with the special case $\phi=-t$ (and $a=0$, $b=T$, so the endpoint dominates the integral)

## Principle of localisation
The [[Asymptotic Expansion]] of $I$ as $x\to \infty$ is determined by contributions from very small regions around the maximum of $\phi$.

### Case monotonic
Suppose $\phi$ is monotonic on $[a,b]$
Let $\phi'(t)>0$ and let $f(b)$
