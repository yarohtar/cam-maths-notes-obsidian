For normed spaces $X$ and $Y$, an isomorphism from $X$ to $Y$ is a map $T:X\to Y$ that is a linear homeomorphism

### Theorem
For a linear bijection $T:X\to Y$ TFAE:
- $T$ is isomorphic
- $T$ and $T^{-1}$ are continuous
- there are some $c,d>0$ such that $c\lVert x \rVert\leq \lVert Tx \rVert\leq d\lVert x \rVert$
