We want to find
$$
y_{j}=(\mathcal{F}_{n}x)_{j}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{l=0}^{n-1} \omega_{n}^{-jl}x_{l}
$$
where $j=0,\dots n-1$. 
Add zeros at the end of $x$ sequence to make $n=2^p$ and set $m=2^{p-1}$
Now denote by $E$ the set of even vertices, and by $O$ the set of odd vertices and assume we found
$$
y^E=\mathcal{F}_{m}x^E\quad \quad y^O=\mathcal{F}_{m}x^O
$$
Note that $\omega_{n}^{2j}=\omega_{2m}^{2j}=\omega_{m}^j$ 
We can combine them to find:
$$
y=
$$
