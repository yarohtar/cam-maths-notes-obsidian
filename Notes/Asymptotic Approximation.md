Suppose we want to approximate $f$ near $x=x_{0}$.
Let $\phi_{k}$ be an [[Asymptotic Sequence]] as $x\to x_{0}$.
We say that the finite sum
$$
\sum_{k=0}^{N} a_k\phi_{k}(x)
$$
is an ($N$-term) asymptotic approximation of $f(x)$ as $x\to x_{0}$ if
$$
f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{N} a_{k}\phi_{k}(x)+o(\phi_{N}(x))
$$
