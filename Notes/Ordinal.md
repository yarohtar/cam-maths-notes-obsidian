An ordinal is a well ordered set, but we identify ordinals that are [[Order-isomorphic]] to each-other. 

[[Order Type]]

### Proposition
Let $\alpha$ be an ordinal. Then thee ordinals strictly less than $\alpha$ form a [[Well-ordered]] set of [[Order Type]] $\alpha$.
#### Proof
Let $X$ be a [[Well-ordered]] set whose [[Order Type]] is $\alpha$ 
Let $X'=\{ Y\subseteq X:Y \text{ is a proper initial segment of }X \}$
$X'$ is [[Linear order]]ed by '$<$' by ....
The map $X\to X'$, sending $x\to I_{x}$ is an [[Order-isomorphic]]
Hence, $X'$ is [[Well-ordered]] by $<$ and so is 
$$
\{ \text{order-type}(Y):Y\in X' \}
$$
which consists exactly of ordinals $<\alpha$.
