An ordinal is a well ordered set, but we identify ordinals that are [[Order-isomorphic]] to each-other. 

[[Order Type]]

### Proposition
Let $\alpha$ be an ordinal. Then thee ordinals strictly less than $\alpha$ form a [[Well-ordered]] set of [[Order Type]] $\alpha$.
#### Proof
Let $X$ be a [[Well-ordered]] set whose [[Order Type]] is $\alpha$ 
Let $X'=\{ Y\subseteq X:Y \text{ is a proper initial segment of }X \}$
