### Helstrom and Hovelo Theorem
You are given a quantum system in unknown state $\ket{\psi}$
You are told $\ket{\psi}$ is either in $\ket{\alpha_{0}}$ or $\ket{\alpha_{1}}$ with probability $\frac{1}{2}$
Do a 2-outcome measurement
Probability of success

$$
p\left(\Pi_{0} \right)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}Tr(\Pi_{0}(\ket{\alpha_{0}} \bra{\alpha_{0}} ))
$$
