A set $X\subseteq \mathbb{B}^{k}$ is called $\Sigma_{1}$ if there is a [[Computable Set]] $Y\subseteq \mathbb{B}^{k+1}$ such that for all $\vec{w}\in \mathbb{B}^{k}$ we have
$$
\vec{w}\in X\iff \exists v((\vec{w},v)\in Y)
$$

### Theorem
Let $X\subseteq \mathbb{B}^{k}$. The following are equivalent:
1. $X$ is [[Computably Enumerable Set]]
2. $X$ is $\Sigma_{1}$
