A set $X$ is called computably enumerable if its [[Pseudo-Characteristic Function]] is [[Computable]].

### Proposition
Let $X\subseteq \mathbb{B}$ be nonempty. Then $X$ is computably enumerable if and only if there is a [[Computable]] function $g:\mathbb{B}\dashrightarrow \mathbb{B}$ such that $X=ran(g)$.

### Proposition 
Any Type 0 [[Formal Language]] $L\subseteq \mathbb{B}$ is computably enumerable. 
(the converse also holds)

### Proposition
The [[Computably Enumerable|computably enumerable]] [[Formal Language]]s are closed under union, intersection, and concatenation; but not under complementation and difference.
