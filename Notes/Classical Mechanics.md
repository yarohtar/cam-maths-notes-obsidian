Motion of a system with $n$ degrees of freedom is described by trajectories in $2n$ dimensional phase space $M$ with local coordinates $(p_{j}, q_{j})$ where $p_{j}$ are momenta and $q_{j}$ are positions (not necessarily physical momenta and positions)

Dynamical variables are functions of form $f:M\times \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$
