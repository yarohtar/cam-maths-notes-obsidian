(I DON'T LIKE THIS EXPLANATION)
Suppose we make $n$ products out of $m$ materials. We make $x_i$ of the $i$th product, and to make $x=(x_1\dots x_n)$ products we need $h_j(x)$ of raw material $j$. We have $b_j$ raw materials. We earn $f(x)$.

So we want to maximise $f(x)$ s.t. $h(x)\leq b, x\geq 0$.

We are now offered a small amount of material $\epsilon=(\epsilon_1\dots\epsilon_m)$. How much should we pay for this?

Let the value function be $\phi(b)=\sup_{x\in X(b)}f(x)$
For small enough $\epsilon$ we have

$$\phi(b+\epsilon)-\phi(b)=\sum_{j=1}^m \frac{\partial\phi(b)}{\partial b_j} \epsilon_j$$
Now the amount we should pay shouldn't exceed $\nabla\phi(b)\epsilon$. Which is also $\lambda^T\epsilon$. We saw this happen in [[Supporting hyperplane#Theorem (Gradient)]]

Note that if $h_j(x)<b_j$, then we are not willing to pay anything for that material. This corresponds to the [[Complimentary slackness]].

When someone is selling us the materials at price $\lambda$, and wants to buy the products later, they are maximising $\lambda^T(h(x)-b)-f(x)$, where we can say that $x=x^*(\lambda)$, because we want to optimise our profits for $\lambda$. So they are actually solving the dual problem to ours. It turns out that if $\lambda$ is the supporting plane, none of us has an incentive to change our strategies.
