A [[Partial Function]] $f:\mathbb{B}^{k}\dashrightarrow \mathbb{B}$ is called computable if there is a register machine $M$ such that $f=f_{M,k}$. 

We say that a [[Partial Numerical Function]] $f$ is computable if and only if its encoding is computable.

A set $X$ is called computable if its [[Characteristic Function]] is computable. This works both for $X\subseteq \mathbb{B}^{k}$ and $X\subseteq \mathbb{N}^{k}$.
