Follows from proof of [[Shannon's noiseless coding theorem]]

Set $s_{i}=\lceil -\log_{a}p_{i} \rceil$ and construct a prefix free code with word lengths $s_{1},\dots,s_{m}$ by taking the $s_{i}$ in increasing order ensuring that previous codewords are not prefixes.
The [[Kraft's inequality]] ensures there is enough room.
