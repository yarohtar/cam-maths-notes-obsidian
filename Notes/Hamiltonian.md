Legendre transform of the Lagrangian $L(t, q, \dot q)$ with respect to $v=\dot q$. Here $q$ is the trajectory.

$$H(t,q,p)=\sup_v(p\cdot v-L)$$
Then $p$ is generalized momentum, and we have $p={\partial L\over \partial \dot q}$. This equation should give $v(p)$ which we sub in to find formula for $H$.

## Hamilton's equations

Suppose $L$ satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equations. Then $H$ satisfies:
$$\dot q = {\partial H\over \partial p}$$
$$\dot p=-{\partial H\over \partial q}$$
$${\partial H\over \partial t} = -{\partial L\over \partial t}$$
