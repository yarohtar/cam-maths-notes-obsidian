A set $X$ is called computably enumerable if its [[Pseudo-Characteristic Function]] is [[Computable Function]].

### Proposition
Let $X\subseteq \mathbb{B}$ be nonempty. Then $X$ is computably enumerable if and only if there is a [[Computable Function]] $g:\mathbb{B}\dashrightarrow \mathbb{B}$ such that $X=ran(g)$.

### Proposition 
Any Type 0 [[Formal Language]] $L\subseteq \mathbb{B}$ is computably enumerable. 
(the converse also holds)
