Consider a [[Discrete Memoryless Channel (DMC)]] 
Let $X$ take values in $\Sigma_{1}$ where $\lvert \Sigma_{1} \rvert=m$ with probabilities $p_{1},\dots ,p_{m}$
Let $Y$ be a random variable output when channel is given input $X$ 

The information channel capacity is 
$$
\max_{X} I(X;Y)
$$
(where $I$ is [[Mutual Information]])
(max is obtained since it is a continuous function on a compact set)
