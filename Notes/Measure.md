Given a set $E$ and a [[sigma-algebra]] $\mathcal{E}$ on it, the pair $(E,\mathcal{E})$ is called a measurable space, while each $A\in \mathcal{E}$ is called a measurable set. 

A function $\mu:\mathcal{E}\to[0,\infty]$ with $\mu(\emptyset)=0$ is called a measure if for any sequence $(A_{n})$ of disjoint elements of $\mathcal{E}$,
$$
\mu\left( \bigcup_{n}A_{n} \right)=\sum_{n}\mu(A_{n})
$$
This property is called countable additivity. 

The triple $(E,\mathcal{E},\mu)$ is called a measure space.
