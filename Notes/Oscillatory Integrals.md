Consider the "Fourier-type" integral
$$
F(x)=\int_{a}^{b}f(t)e^{ix\phi(t)}dt
$$
and we want the behaviour as $x\to \infty$.
Note that this is different to [[Laplace integrals]] because here the integrand oscillates like crazy instead of blowing up, leading to catastrophic cancellation

$f$ is the amplitude / envelope functions
$x\phi$ is the phase
$x \frac{d\phi}{dt}$ is the local wavenumber $\frac{1}{\lambda}$
