Can take a subset of a set. This is an axiom scheme
$$
(\forall t_{1})\dots (\forall t_{n})(\forall x)(\exists y)(\forall z)(z\in y \iff(z\in x\land p))
$$
where $p$ is a formula with $FV(p)=\{ z,t_{1},\dots,t_{n} \}$
The set $y$ whose existence is asserted by (Sep) is unique by (Ext)
We denote this $y$ by $\{ z\in x\mid p \}$
Formally, we are introducing an $(n+1)$-arry operation symbol to the language.
