et $L\subseteq \mathbb{W}$ be a [[Formal Language]]
We say $L$ satisfies the regular pumping lemma with pumping number $n$ if for every word $w\in L$ with $\lvert w \rvert\geq n$ there are words $x,y,z$ such tat $w=xyz$ and for all $k\in \mathbb{N}_{0}$ we have $xy^{k}z\in L$.

### Theorem
For every [[Regular Formal Language]] $L$, there is a number $n$ st $L$ satisfies regular pumping lemma with pumping number $n$.
#### Proof
$L$ is generated by some [[Deterministic Automata]] $D=(\Sigma,Q,\delta,q_{0},F)$.

We claim $n=\lvert Q \rvert$.

Take any $w\in L$ with $\lvert w \rvert\geq n$.
Let $w=w_{1}w_{2}\dots w_{n}w'$
where $w_{i}\in \Sigma$ and $w'\in \Sigma ^{*}$.

By Pigeon Hole Principle, there are some $0\leq i<j\leq n$ st
$\delta(q_{0},w_{1}\dots w_{i})=\delta(q_{0},w_{1}\dots w_{j})$
(ie we returned to the same state)

Now label $x=w_{1}\dots w_{i}$, $y=w_{i+1}\dots w_{j}$ and $z=w_{j+1}\dots w_{n}w'$
and prove by induction that $xy^{k}z$ is still accepted (starting from $k=0$!!!)
