The language of propositional logic consists of a set $P$ of primitive propositions and the set $L=L(P)$ of propositions (or compound propositions) is as follows:
1. $P\subseteq L$
2. $\bot\in L$
3. if $p,q\in L$ then $(p \implies q)\in L$

We further define $L_{0}=P\cup \{ \bot \}$ and 
$L_{n+1}=\{ p \implies q: p,q\in L_{n} \}$
