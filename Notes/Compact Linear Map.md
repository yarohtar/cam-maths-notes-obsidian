For $X$, $Y$ [[Normed Spaces|normed]], say linear $T:X\to Y$ is compact if $\overline{T(B_{X})}$ is compact.
### Notes
- If $T:X\to Y$ compact, then certainly, $T(B_{X})$ is bounded, so $T$ is continuous.
- For $Y$ complete, $T:X\to Y$ is compact iff $T(B_{X})$ totally bounded
- $T:X\to Y$ compact iff For any $(x_{n})$ in $B_{X}$, there is a subsequence $(x_{n_{i}})$ with $(Tx_{n_{i}})$ converges in $Y$.
