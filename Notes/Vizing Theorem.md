Let $G$ be a graph with $\Delta(G)=\Delta$
Then $\chi'(G)=\Delta$ or $\chi'(G)=\Delta+1$
### Proof
Clearly $\chi'(G)\geq \Delta$
WTS $\chi'(G)\leq \Delta+1$
Induction on edges
Pick an edge $xy_{1}$ and colour everything else in $\Delta+1$
Construct the longest sequence of distinct $y_{1}y_{2}\dots y_{k}$
where if $y_{i}$ is missing colour $c_i$ then $x$
