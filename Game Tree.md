Let $Y$ be a set of finite sequences such that 
- any initial segment of an element of $Y$ is in $Y$
- any element of $Y$ is a proper initial segment of an element of $Y$.
Then $Y$ is called a game tree.
### Interpretation
Each element of $Y$ represents a valid game state after finitely many moves.
