Let $Y$ be a [[Game Tree]].
A [[Subgame Tree]] $X$ of $Y$ is `I`-imposed if 
$$
(y_{0},\dots,y_{2n})\in X \land (y_{0},\dots,y_{2n},y_{2n+1})\in Y \implies (y_{0},\dots,y_{2n},y_{2n+1})\in X
$$
### Interpretation
Any move legal for `II` in $Y$ is still legal in $X$, but `I` might have some restrictions.
