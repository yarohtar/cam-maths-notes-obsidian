More complicated systems require "larger" Hilbert spaces. We ccan build these by taking tensor products

Let $dim(\mathcal{H}_{1}),dim(\mathcal{H}_{2})<\infty$ and let $\{ e_{a} \}\in \mathcal{H}_{1}$ and $\{ f_{\alpha} \}\in \mathcal{H}_{2}$ be orthonormal bases.
Then
$$
\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_{1}\times \mathcal{H}_{2}
$$
is the tensor product that contains all elements of form
$$
\ket{\psi} =\sum_{a,\alpha}c_{a,\alpha}\ket{e_{a}} \times \ket{f_{\alpha}}
$$
The inner product is defined on basis elements
$$
(\bra{e_{a}} )
$$
