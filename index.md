On this website you will find my notes as I write them throughout my time in Cambridge.

No content presented on this website is official nor endorsed by the University (or people associated with the University) 
and it is not an accurate representation of what was lectured or what is examined.
While some notes were taken during lectures, a big part was created after lectures / during revision and heavily modified based on various resources.
In particular, all errors are my own.

The lecture notes were created in Obsidian (https://obsidian.md/). 
If you want to view them in the app, you can find the setup guide here:
