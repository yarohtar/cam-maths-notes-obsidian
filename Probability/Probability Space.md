A [[Measure|measure space]] $(\Omega,\mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ is called a probability space if $\mathbb{P}(\Omega)=1$

provides a model for an experiment whose outcome is subjective to chance, 
according to the following interpretation:
- $\Omega$ is the set of possible outcomes
- $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of observable sets of outcomes or events
- $\mathbb{P}(A)$ is the probability of the event $A$.

In addition to [[Measure|measure theory]], 
probability theory also has the notion of [[Independence]].
