Let $\Omega$ be a set and $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ a [[sigma-algebra]] on it.
Let $\mathbb{P}:\mathcal{F}\to[0,\infty]$.
Suppose:
- $\mathbb{P}$ is a [[Measure]] on $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$
- $\mathbb{P}(\Omega)=1$
Then $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ is a probability space.
Equivalently:
A [[Measure Space]] $(\Omega,\mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ is called a probability space if $\mathbb{P}(\Omega)=1$.

The function $\mathbb{P}$ is called [[Probability Measure]]

Probability space provides a model for an experiment
whose outcome is subjective to chance.
The interpretation is as follows:
- $\Omega$ is the set of possible outcomes
- $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of observable sets of outcomes or events
- $\mathbb{P}(A)$ is the probability of the event $A$.

In addition to [[Measure|measure theory]], 
probability theory also has the notion of [[Independence]].
